"Firstly, i was kind of skeptical regarding this game because I did not like the ”anime„ theme and the way the game was developed, also I did consider the graphics poorly designed. However, the most important element of a game are not the graphics nor the development of it but the actual gameplay value and the overall enjoyment, things that this game succeeds drastically. Shadowverse is a card-board game thing... with different classes and different cards of different rarities. As a card-board game there are 4 major things that influence your win rate. The RNG ( random number generator), your deck quality and the  match-making system and your strategy. I was amazed to find out that this game, who looks poorly desiged managed to control the RNG factor so smoothly. SHAME ON YOU HEARTHSTONE (piratestone, heroes of patches). Match-making system works smoothly as well, there are a lot of strategies and playstyles.Now, talking about the deck quality... You see it is kinda hard for a new player to get the expensive cards or to understand how to spend their resources on improving his deck. For a new player, this game is INCREDIBLY friendly. I have opened like 30-40 packs in one hour of gameplay, and i had enough resources to build a competitive deck ( btw, u can import decks via codes which is a life saver )LET-S TALK ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD NOT PLAY THIS(cons)1) it looks cheap / poorly designed2) it is too weeaboo, too much anime3) voice acting looks badLETS TALK ABOUT WHY U SHOULD PLAY THIS (pros)1) it is catchy2) it is friendly3) it has cool mechanics4) it will not make you wanna punch your monitor 5) you will not be grinding too much gold for s**tty cards (if you have played hearthsone: grinding 3 wings of an adventure with useless cards just to get to the last one with all the meta-used cards)Overall, i would rate this game with 8/10 just because i hate it„s oppai-anime theme and graphics. THis game is great.  "
"Only game where opening packs and expanding your collection of cards doubles as opening packs and expanding your collection of waifus and husbandos. 10.666/10 devs do not believe in the heresy that is RNGesus. If you do download this game, be sure to bring scuba gear because they attempt to drown you with card packs"
Better than Hearthstone in many aspects:Amazing cards artwork (call me a weeb if you want to)Every classes have their own unique playstyleLess toxic communityLess pay to winNot sure about the balance because some legendary card's effect are broken (FREAKNIG Bahamut)Ofcourse you can play it on your phone or tablet 8/10Hope the development keep on improving the game and make the community grow 
"Since Hearthstone decided to take out their ""Wing"" expansions in favour of more Packs, I decided to start looking for another online card game to play. Shadowverse caught my eye and I decided to give it a try...I really really want to like this game but it just isn't good. So apparently right when you start this game, it's heavily advised that you ""reroll"" your account to get a good start. So for the first two days of playing this game I wasn't actually playing, I was just constantly playing the tutorial --> buying all the free packs --> opening said packs for good legendaries --> reseting the app data and trying again. Today I was finally able to break the cycle and actually play the game and oh boy was it not fun at all. The starter cards they give you are so insanely bad that even clearing the single player content becomes a grind of replaying missions until you draw the right cards and your opponent doesn't. After messing around in single player for a bit I decided to see what online was like and it wasn't any better. The person I was playing against played a card that literally couldn't take damage from anything. Fun gameIf you quit Hearthstone and are looking for another game to scratch that itch, this probably isn't the one"
"Take Hearthstone► Remove bad RNG► Add a sh*tload of free content + rewards► Give player more chances of getting good cards► Add Lolis and BoobsAaaand voilà, you got Shadowverse11/10 players would be horny again."
Good game really. I enjoy this game lots and lots. But sometimes on ranked you win and opponent dc:s. After that you are stuck in game solo and when you leave. You just lose the game cause forfeit and you just stomped the opponent.
"I have been playing this since June and it is easily my favorite digital card game of 2016.  Has one of the best rates to pull Legendary cards from packs compared to other games.  Free packs are also bountiful and easy to obtain (58 for just starting the game as of this review).  Even better, the overall cards are very well balanced with each deck archetype having their own pros and cons.  The game's company has done a tremendous job at managing and handling the game thus far, and it feels like it is only going to keep improving."
"Out of the digital card games out right now, I believe this is the best one.  I have played Hearthstone, Duelyst, Eternal, Elder Scrolls Legends, Gwent, and Shadowverse.I feel like Shadowverse takes a lot of inspiration from Hearthstone, without making too many of the same mistakes.  Hopefully anime girls don't bother you because you'll be seeing plenty of them.The main mechanic that makes Shadowverse stand out from Hearthstone is 'Evolve.'  This gives a follower +2/+2 and allows them to attack an opposing follower immediately.  Some cards even have effects that activate when they are evolved.  In addition to drawing an extra card, the second turn player will also get one more opportunity to evolve.  First player gets to evolve twice, second player can evolve three times.Right now the meta game is fairly balanced.  It seems like all the classes have viable decks.  If you care about being super competitive the best class for aggro is bloodcraft.  That would be the best/cheapest deck to try and rank up if that's all you care about."
"A lot of cute girls, funny or annoying guys, ugly, awesome, and/or sickening monsters, and a lot of crazy moments that make you feel like a total boss or like a pathetic slave. It's a rollercoaster of a game, and the experience seems to change drastically with every new card set that comes out.One of the most interesting things they do is they use the same 'hero power' for every class, and instead give each class their own trait. Personally, I have some misgivings about some of the design decisions they've made for the various classes, but it's undeniable that each class feels very different from the others.Draw RNG is a big deal in this game, the decks have to be small, not quite as small as in Hearthstone, but considering that you can include up to 3 copies of each card that you want in your deck, it can arguably feel like your decks are even smaller than a Hearthstone deck when it comes to the decision of which cards to use when making a deck.Fortunately, it's not incredibly difficult to get some wins in this game, you can find yourself and others failing hard due to being flabbergasted by unfamiliar cards. Many cards perform much differently than how you would expect them to, which leaves a lot of room for exploration of the mechanics of the game as well as the flow of power. They are introducing new stuff pretty much all the time, similarly to how Wizards of the Coast does things, and surprisingly they love to make crazy cards that challenge the way you think about the game. Unfortunately, much like for Hearthstone, it can be difficult at times to acquire the cards you need to be competitive.I actually feel satisfied with the comeback mechanic of first player vs second player compared to Hearthstone for example...the player going second gets to hero power one turn earlier than the player going first, and on top of that gets to do it one extra time per game. Your deck type will largely determine whether going first or second is preferred, or if it matters little to not at all...and some cards can even manipulate the number of times you use it. This 'hero power' is actually known as evolving your followers in this game. They get the +2/+2 or whatever modified stat boost if they are some special card, and sometimes some special effect while evolving...and they will not be affected by summoning sickness...but still won't have haste/storm. It's essentially the same as having rush, but they don't call it having rush for some reason. They actually call haste/charge storm, and storm followers can go for the leader(player's life/health) right away while rush followers can only attack other followers.Arena mode is pretty interesting since the game gives you arena tickets at times so you can try out the various cards. Also, if you are dedicated enough, you can complete more daily quests in this game than in Hearthstone...they are perhaps as difficult to complete at times as the Magic Duels quests, and other times they are easier if you just happen to be lucky.The multiplayer experience could use some loving, particularly in the animations blocking out the turn time area. Shortened animations option in the menu only seems to apply to leaders, and not to followers, and followers have a habit of being show-hogs. It has a ways to go to match Hearthstone in sheer gaming functionality, but it's straight up far more playable  than Magic Duels."
"Like this game, comparable to hearthstone, but the developers are much more generous in giving packs, so you can have a competitive deck built out fairly quickly, and are less reliant on RNG for board effects"
"I've been playing many card game (ygo, ws, hs, pvzh etc) and this one also feels soo great! Really enjoyed it so far. it have a simple good story, very nice graphic art and animation, very nice interface and great BGM!"
"This game used to be awesome. I remember last year playing this game and having a blast with it. I came back around September of last year to play the game again and the game started to get terrible in my honest opinion. They changed some of the really good cards (Lightning Blast for example) and turned them into useless cards. The Wonderland Expansion SUCKED! After I got fed up with the impossible to beat AI and lack of balance in the game, I stopped playing. I come back just yesterday to enjoy this game as I did last year. The game has gotten so much worse with these new expansions and the even further lack of balance. I just can't enjoy this game anymore. Cygames ruined such a great game and now are literally a clone of Blizzard and they're money grubbing business model. I'll always remember the fun I had playing this game last year when it was awesome. If you really want a good free-to-play card game on Steam, play Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links. Konami is doing something that Blizzard and Cygames are not doing, which is making the game FUN!"
"Pros- Totally super addicting- ANIME- Lots of lots of lots of kawaii grills!- Outstanding voice-actings for every leaders and cards- Game is very very generous to beginners. (50 free packs, 10 packs per set. Enough to build a standard deck)Cons- RNG (That one draw). But is still fine.- Needs dedication to build more and stronger decks unless you wanna pay. But note, that in my opinion, game is NOT PAY 2 WIN but rather Pay 2 get a better deck and more kawaii grills earilier.- A few balance problem here and there but isn't totally sky-high.Overall, solid 10/10 for me. Would get smashed by Anne's Sorcery again."
"Got 6 legendary cards from the free packs they gave me, i was pretty hyped!!Then my little brother on his tablet got 11 legendary cards..He doest even understand the game!!Uninstalling"
"Vampychan Toujou!!!a great CCG by Cygames. Very F2P friendly, however price can go high pretty fast if you want the best teir all the time.The dev works super hard to balance the games (frequent updates) and make the game bigger.Same game play as hearthstone, but has more skill based elements (like evolve) and much less RNG aspect (aside for draws, which often times determines the win :/)Although I cant say its best ccg I played, its definately one of my fav ones to continue to play. Also waifus.  "
"The game is unbalance, going first has so much advantage. The meta are mostly aggro and midrange. The preemptive nerf was unjustified that pushed dragon and haven down the hole. The devs doesn't seem to know how to fix their game."
"I love this game, the thing that I like the most is the art style it's really beautiful and I'm always exciting for the next expansion to see more cards and their art.The game is pretty simple but there are lots of interesting mechanics, all the classes have lots of different archetypes that play different and also there are cards that allow you to build a deck around that card and overall this make the game really fun.The f2p model is amazing, at the beginning the game gives a huge amount of packs and take 2 tickets so you have  a really good start, then it haves lots of ways to earn more gold for packs like doing the story mode, playing private matches and beating the ai in different difficulties, once you exhaust all the initial achievement to get gold you will get a huge amount of card to start you collection and make some homebrew decks and even meta decks but with the daily login system and the ranked reward and with the often events that they make you never feel like you gaining slow amount of gold.I really enjoy the story, you get to know the characters and their backgrounds and it makes me feel more involved playing each class and I look forward to see how the story develop.One huge problem with the game is that there's not chat whatsoever this is really bad, outside of emotes you can't communicate in any way even with friends, if I play with someone and I really enjoy the game and we add each other there's no way for us to communicate  so hopefully this is something they add in the future.With the announcement of a new class, rotation and in-game tournament I'm really exciting for this game in the future."
"I wanted to find a good online CCG. This game started fun, but it quickly became a mess of agro and the ""you win"" card. In the current meta, there are 3 agro decks, the ""why wasn't this card fixed day 1?"" forestcraft deck, the ""you lose turn 9 if you aren't holding odin"" heavencraft deck, and the ""I'm going to play this game by myself"" spellcraft deck. Making a 'new', 'creative' deck doesn't work because every game ends before turn 10. Even though I got 50 card packs when I started the game, I every deck I made didn't work. It took me about 20 hours of gameplay to get to this point of frustration."
"some people may found my review is not good, i like anime manga japan culture etc. , so i like the art and voice / soundtrack , but some ppl cant take it. its more playable for newb than hearthst*ne , u will get free 10 pack each expansion, atleast will get 5 legend card, u can transform some card to vial and create anycard, so u even u are u newb u can build mid to high tune deck with ur  type-craft u good at, and play story and versus bot actually make some money too, try it if u want, its not that bad as ppl review, hope this help u :) gl hf"
"Famous Japanese voice actress / seiyuu , extremely good and beautiful art, smooth gameplay , challenge friends in arena and have fun, climb ranks and battle a competetive matches with other players! A not RNG based card game that you'd be hooked to!Dont let the other negative reviews fool you. They just became salty after their deck got balanced."
"CCG games which its mechanic are mostly the same with Hearthstone, eventhought its still ages juz around for 1 year, Cygames generosity, plus the fact that the game is f2p, there is no reason not to try it~"
"Good card game. Many playstyles, no HS-like value decks disguised as different classes. Dev team gives you ample gifts. In fact, they give away so many things its appropriate to say that again; Cygames is very generous and will constantly give away goodies like free packs and custom emblems. You will have plenty of cards and money and will have no problem building at least 1 or 2 competitive decks. Take Two is also very fun and has its own meta. The balance is not the same as it was in the game's infancy, but the team is constantly evaluating what's fair. Balance is as good as you will see for CCG's, #1 in the market in my opinion."
I wouldn't play largely a pay 2 win game if your a beginner with no cash theres no point to even touch pvp. The unbalanced pvp makes this autrociusly bad you can't win unless you have good tier deck. Their take two system is so RNG based that you can go in and usually win 1/5 of the games.
"No-skill. Rush play. Pay-to-win.What else is to say? You just have to spend 10 bucks and you can win easily. It's mostly anyway just one (ONE!!!) card that instantly tells if you win or not. Everyone plays either storm decks (no cost cards that instantly attack the face/leader) or turtle to turn 8 where they play one card that practically marks their victory.The game has beautiful card arts and looks and feels good, but in the end it's the mechanics that count. Some legendary (super rare) cards literally have everything. There are moments where you or the enemy plays one card in early or mid game and the opponent or you respectively can just surrender. No counterplays, no thinking. Just praying for those few cards to pop up. People said the developer ""destroyed"" a good game with the updates, but I played 40 hours in this version (Dawnbreak/Nightedge) of the game. And there just one thing to tell about it:It's utter trash.So don't waste your precious lifetime playing this if you don't plan to spend 10 bucks on a winning deck that actually is a no-brainer (because all winning decks are). And even though you get lots of cards for free as a starter, the chance to get a (yes, a; singular) good card is close to 0. In 40 hours I could have learned a lot of JavaScript. Instead I learned again why F2P games have such a bad reputation. ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥"
"I highly recommend this game.  There are all forms of waifus if you like normal girls or demongirls.  I was let down by the lack of monstergirls and futas but I'm over it now.  The gameplay is also very good.  The game is easily as good as Hearthstone if not better.  It boasts an evolve system where you can increase most followers attack and health by 2/2.  A few followers have abilities that activate on evolve as well.  There are 7 classes that all have unique mechanics built into them.  Overall I quite like this game I came for the waifus and stayed for the gameplay.In the words of Kripparian, turns out it's pretty good.   "
"Golly it's chilly in here.But really, this is far better than Hearthstone. The draft format Take Two is way more interesting than Arena and the evolution mechanics add a really thick layer of strategy and tempo to the game. The devs are also really generous with free stuff."
"Highly recommend it, if you're tired from RNGstone and want to find a competitive well diversed CCG this is it! And don't be afraid about accessing cards for your decks, they are very generous to their community and help them out a lot with packs etc."
"WOW. Cygames has demonstrated astounding levels of artistry in terms of card design and game balance.Like any other competitive card game, you have your tier one decks. But they do not dominate the ladder in a way that is restrictive to people who want to experiment or play lower tier decks (provided you're a decent player, and willing to actually try to build optimal strategies).Though only two expansions have been released at the time of writing this review, both have introduced powerful and interesting cards into the meta that create new and powerful tier 1 strategies, but do not break and dominate the game.Not to mention, arena 'Take Two' is an elegant take on drafting, and the arena meta has been quite fun and healthy.The flavor of the game isn't really my style, but the art is far from ugly. Visuals are well-crafted, and I find myself often interested or amused by the flavor text displayed during the loading screens in-between matches.Of course it's hard to talk about the merits of Shadowverse without bringing up the Hearthstone comparison. As a long-time Hearthstone player with multiple Legend finishes, I can safely say that I'm moving to Shadowverse, at least for the time being. It simply lacks the problems that have been plaguing Hearthstone since the introduction of 'Standard' mode: Cygames is willing to take risks in card design and encourage decks that feel different from one another, and is willing to make relatively quick adjustments to game balance if something goes wrong.I cannot sing enough praise for this game, as someone who plays or played many TCGs and CCGs actively and competitively, I can say without-a-doubt that Shadowverse is quite the achievement, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.Oh, and don't let anyone tell you that you can't play this game competitively for free; be smart with how you liquify cards and spend your in-game currency, and you can easily build top-tier decks within days of one another."
"♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME! It's a really good card game, the classes are very diverse, it's not a Blizzard-Cashcow, it feels balanced, it's fun (at times) and generous, can't complain about that, but seriously: ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!The Campaigns are frustratingly difficult at times, some decktypes just seem so awefully bad compared to others and the bad topdecks in this game will be on your side while your enemy crushes you over and over again. Especially in the Single Player Mode. By the way: The Single Player is aweful as hell anyway. The dialogs are cringe-worthyly bad! And the AI is unfair as hell, having some seriously overpowered cards more than 3 times in their deck (3 being the maximum for the player). I can't tell of the multiplayer experience is any better, I highly hope it is, but I am not sure if I want to find out since at this point I am more willing to force a cactus into my butt than to play another minute of this game! I'd still recommend it though if you have a higher frust-toleration than me."
"I will probably never get tired of Shadowverse. Like others have said it's a great cardgame with beautiful artwork. However, it's also really easy to get materials for card and free card packs. I usually get enough extras to liquify in order to create new legendaries that come out each expansion. I can't remember the last time I paid for something that wasn't just a skin (eg, special cardpack with special art)I started to play Shadowverse during beta when it was still mobile-only. The only way I could play it was using an emulator which had graphical lag and would crash all the time. I'm so happy for the Steam version and it runs beautifully."
"For those who love anime, this could be irresistible not to play. The game has a nice pace of giving off a pack of card for the players which is vital to ccg kind of a game. The gameplay itself isn't bad. I think what makes ccg fun to play is that stroke of luck by drawing that certain card that wins you the match and this game has that. If we're talking about the balance of the card, it is pretty much balance, unless you got really really unlucky. You can experience this if you spend a certain period of time playing the game.For additional insight, I have experienced a so-called meta in this game. But rest assure, the meta itself actually doesn't feel so bad. It is just that you could be bored when you encounter a certain people with the same kind of meta. I mean, if you can find something else to create with your own deck, why even bother following some meta (except if you're really obsessed with the victory, not the fun in building a deck).Overall it is nice and that's it, since this is a f2p game, it doesn't hurt to try."
"Hey guys this is my first ""review"" ! This game has one of the best communities i have ever seen especially on reddit.The guys who made this game are fricking awesome giving you packs constantly and rewarding even for logging in.You get a ton of cards so you can keep up with the players who play longer than you.Its greatly balanced and 0% pay to win.To be honest this game is worth playing just for the artwork of the cards alone.I´ve spent quite some time just looking at all the cards!I highly recommend you to play if u enjoy card games and its a must play if u are into anime VoHiYo!Have fun friends"
"You know, I was expecting a medicore game, but I'm surprised at the amount of content you get this game. Not to mention they give you like 30 free packs to start with. It's pretty great. The art work is hit and miss sometimes, with some of it being really weeb (Japanese anime style) and others having really cool art. It's a really solid game that kind of removes a lot of the RNG that you get in Hearthstone.Only complaint would be that the game isn't as smooth to play as Hearthstone. Perhaps one day they'll get it up to parity. Until then, you can bet that I'll keep playing it. I love that there are campaigns that give you rewards. Pretty cool."
"Addictive anime Hearthstone. Evolving mechanic is pretty neat. Very generous with free cards and bonuses, doesn't feel grindy for a F2P card game. (or at least at the time of this posting.)"
"Seriously incredible game.  If you can look past the weeby-art, you'll see a super solid game.  Played this game for countless hours on my phone.  Elements are similar to other card games like MTG and Hearthstone, but it clearly has a design in a different direction.  Barely any RNG.  Up and away my favorite online card game.Great time to start a collection too, as the game is young.  The devs hand out free stuff all the time and its seriously awesome. The balancing is great too (more like Rock-paper-scissors than 2-3 dominant decks)Tbh, the art is really well done if a bit risque. Just try it."
"BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE CARD GAME OF THE YEAR WHICH IS HEARTSTONE RIP-OFF BUT WITH WAIIIFUUUFEATURING 7 CLASSES +1 NEUTRAL AND 7 STORIES OF CHARACTERS(or Waifus) AT YOUR CHOICEEMBRACE THE SALT MINING OF...- YOUR 1ST HAND DRAW- YOUR MATCH DECISIVE DESTINY DRAW- YOUR OPPONENT 1 TURN KILL METAs- WHEN YOU BUY DOZEN OF CARD PACKS BUT DIDN'T GOT A SINGLE LEGENDARY CARD- AND THE DAILY MISSIONS THAT REQUIRE YOUR ""NOT MY MAIN DECK"" TO WINS ON COMPETITVE RANK MODE"
"I got the game out of curiosity, but its surprisingly good. The graphics are astonishly beautiful, and the animations are all right too. The cards look good and some of them is worth a glimpse or too. The card game seems to be well balanced, you can have fun with it, and later you want to play more. It does not feel like grinding, and the stories are well built up. It is recommended to play through all the character stories for more reasons, like learning how the decks work, and to understand what is going on exactly. In each story, I have encountered an enemy that was too strong to defeat on first try and needed to play a few times to achieve victory. I used the basic story deck, but you can create a completely new one and use that in the story mode. You can even link the game to your mobile phone, to play portable. The game surprises you with good bonuses and with the holidays here you get even more, which I felt really appreciated. Pros:- Nice graphics and animations- Story looks interesting- Nice bonuses- No griding feeling yet- You don’t have to spend real money to build up some decent decks- Can be linked to mobile- Has active multiplayer- Own decks can be built and customized easily- Frequently upcoming new contentsCons:- Each story mode has a difficult enemy on later stage (this is fine for me)- After completing almost all the stories you can get annoyed of the conversations you already heard- Decks can be sometimes confusing- Multiplayer can be hard, but you need to try regardless- The extra evolution point for the 2nd player seems to be a big advantage"
the game looks like hearthstone but has things that make it to have a own thing going on. like the evolve mechanic and a story mode to get used to the classes and see if it fits your playstyle.a friend of mine told me that this is easyer to get into than hearthstone. since its free is suggest at least trying it out.
Excellent card game with constant special events and expansions that actually add new ways to play or improve current decks instead of making favourite less vaiable to use. Also they just released a new expansion and pretty interesting their giving some power to neutral cards in a way that I think a lot of people will find refreshing. The developers are always tweaking things and making changes when particular cards or decks are starting to limit the deck building or gameplay with the added touch of giving you more vials when you disenchant cards. To add the new player curve is really easy to overcome they give u a lot of free packs I've never spent money and I'm on a pretty even playing grounds with those who probably do. So all in all it's a great game and it's free to play in the more positive sense so there's no reason not to download it and start conversing with the Shadows! (I know it's lame but the game is definitely not).
"I've been a fan of card games for a long time now. I've played Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh, MTG, Krosmaga and probably every other game out there. Many of them are really good but have that one big flaw. You have to spend A LOT of money to play competitively.Not Shadowverse though.I've been playing for about 170h as of the 1st of July and I haven't spent a dime. I have all the important cards and can play on a high level, slowly but steadily approching Master rank. Cygames gives out a lot of packs which makes the game a lot more interesting as you have more cards to play with and thus more dekcs to try out.Last Expansion was a little static and quite boring, due to the same 4-5 decks being played all the time, but nerfs came through pretty quickly and made it better. Now with the new expansion Wonderland Dreams, the game got a lot more diverse and fun.The anime aestethics might not be everyones cup of tea, but if you can ignore that and the fact that the game itself feels a little clumsy due to it being a mobile port, Shadowverse is a great game for card game lovers that doesn't try to take your money out of your pockets.Tl:drGreat game. Free2Win. Anime visuals might not be your thing and feels a little clumsy. Nontheless the best CCG out there right now."
"One of the best card game in ending 2016.I played hearthstone since beta and I used to love that game but now they're making the worst card game ever with full of rng that we didn't need/want and making all other archtype like priest useless which the game should of called warlock the trading card game.Shadowverse brought a new light to trading card game plus you can play any class you want and still be good at it unlike hearthstone.Hearthstone classes are boring and not even that fun to play their theme because it's so simple while shadowverse every carft is unqine and fun to play and vs with. (I love havencraft)Also Shadowverse offer so much free stuff like over $100 value of card pack that you can mess around with a deck plus much more unlock on the way which making this game unlike hearthstone where you can pay $10 to get worthless legendary and 10 card pack without offering anything to f2p players like wut?They even made alt win for havencraft so they can mess around with building a different deck which offers great deck builder unlike hearthstone where the deck building is so boring and dumb.TL;DRPro:Offers $100 value packs for free to players who started on the gameStory mode which is great for telling us the lore and origin of characters unlike hearthstone saying ""oh too bad go buy our Warcraft and you can learn about it from the chracters I don't care"" (leaving up to you if you think the story is good or bad but it ended a cliffhanger but it's coming soon)Decent Single Player ContactFun as hell Crafts to playBalance gameplay which all crafts are good in their own wayCan get acesss to legendary easiler than heartstone couldGreat gameplayGreat mobile portCons:Voice acting isn't that great in some cases (if you playing English dub)Censorship (plz don't make this yugioh TCG censorship) there's a way to uncensor it thoughThis just made hearthstone an almost dead game now even people are switching from hearhtstone to shadowverse (Kripp, reyend, and etc)I don't like this game because it's card game with waifu so don't bash me the reason on it"
" ''It's Hearthstone with waifus! Haha. Give me thumbs up :)'' This is all i saw when i scrolled through the reviews. There are a few actual good reviews but not many that are really serious or helpful. The ones that are helpful usually compare the game to Heathstone as well, but instead give an actual review with it. With all the comparisons with Hearthstone and other card games it may be hard to judge if you want to give this game a try if you, just like me, never played a digital card game before. This review is not for people that are pretty familiar with digital card games but if you want a full first experience of a person that never played one, you might want to stick around to see if it is something you are interested in as well. My experience with card games so far So first things first: I always wanted to play a digital card game because it looked fun but i have never seen any that interested me enough to actually download one. Heartstone for example did not look interesting to me at all because it is set in the WoW universe, which i have never played before. Not wanting to dive deep into unknown territory i looked for some card games on Steam but they were either poorly made or a cash grab. Losing the interest in looking for games and not having time to browse the internet for hours, i gave up. That is until one day this gem appeared out of thin air on Steam's front page. Apperantly it was an app that was available on mobile for a while now and has recently been ported to the PC. Seeing it had the ''Anime'' tag, my inner weeb got triggered (im not really a weeb guys i just like anime, ok?) and i downloaded the game.  First impressions  Skip this if you don't enjoy salt and / or just don't care about my story My first impressions were actually quite good. I really enjoyed the artwork and the voice acting was on point as well (for a voice-over, game has Japanese devs). The tutorial was good and taught me some basic things about card games which was nice because i had never played one before. After finishing the tutorial the game gave me some rewards and told me to try one of the class stories (i will return to this topic later), which i did. After a small bit of story telling the game put me in yet another tutorial, this time a class tutorial to teach me how the class works that im playing. It explained it fairly well and i started my first mission. I beat my opponent fairly easily (the AI was pretty dumb and had reduced health), and started the next one. The 2nd one was a bit harder but i still won. The 3rd one was also not really a problem since i was now starting to understand digital card games a bit more. When i got to the 6th mission however, this all changed. The AI was no longer bad or had reduced health and destroyed me 3 times in a row. Getting more and more frustrated by the minute i decided to try my hands on the deck building that apperantly was needed to progress since the default decks aren't that great. I had absolutely no clue what i was doing for about half an hour. Having become even more frustrated in the mean time, i made my first mistake... i tried to beat the 6th mission again, with my new ''deck''. My deck at the time was... terrible to say the least. I got beaten easily by an AI opponent again multiple times and at times when i almost beat him he would do some very (and i mean VERY) cheap move which would lead to my defeat yet again and wanting me to throw my PC out the window. This is where i made my second mistake: i closed the game out of anger and didn't touch it for at least a day. After doing a lot of research in the mean time, i began giving up hope that card games would be something that i would enjoy playing because they were extremely difficult. After a day or so i completely forgot about the game but quickly saw it again in my library. Wanting to give it one last shot i started the game up again. This is where things changed though, i was now learning a lot more from research than actually playing and i managed to progress further into the story. Instead of trying the 7th mission and risking getting frustrated again i tried playing one of the other classes to see if they were any better. Good lord they were better. I managed to finish two whole class stories before returning to that hellish 7th one from the first class. Trying it over and over but still not managing to beat it i decided to leave it where it was. My experience now 20 hours later and i have still not beaten that 7th mission. I don't know if it's my deck or just the class im playing as (forestcraft if you want to know), but i find it to be nearly impossible. I finished some of the other class stories, enjoyed some a lot, others not that much, and also tried some pvp. I will have to say that this game is absolutely amazing. The artwork is beautiful, the classes feel very unique and the animations are cool as well. It was hard to learn at first but i spend some time doing research and watching videos and while i still don't understand everything that well i have to say that im doing a lot better now than i did before (im even able to make my own decks now without giving myself brain damage). If you never played a card game before you might want to have some knowledge first so you don't feel like punching your PC like i did sometimes. The game is not that hard if you know the basics and it's a lot of fun to play the stories of the different classes instead of just having pvp or meaningless AI in some other card games (however pvp in this game is very good as well). The devs are very generous with rewards and you will be able to make a good deck fairly easily from the start if you have the knowledge to do so. Classes Time to talk about the classes. There are currently 7 classes in Shadowverse, each one feeling completely unique and playing entirely different. If you want to know what each class does you really have to try them for yourself but i will try to give a brief explanation: Forestcraft  focusses on playing a lot of weak, low-cost fairies in order to boost other cards and overwhelm your opponent. Swordcraft  has cards that can summon other (weak) allies when played and strengthen them according to their role (officer and commander). Currently my favorite class. Runecraft  specializes in playing spells in order to strenghten other spells currently in your hand. Dragoncraft  has cards that allow you to get more points (which are needed to play cards) to get to late game quickly and boost your cards with the ''overflow'' ability when you do so. Shadowcraft  gains shadows when allies die or when certain cards are played, which are consumed in order to make other cards more powerful when they are played. Bloodcraft  has many cards that damage your leader in order to get below 50% health so your ''vengance'' ability activates which gives certain cards a massive advantage. Currently my least favorite class. Havencraft  has amulets that summon powerful allies when they are destroyed. Havencraft also is the best class at healing allies and your leader and is able to destroy their own amulets faster with certain cards.Each class also has their own story which is quite interesting and gives them a personality instead of just being a blank and uninteresting face. Cards Steam thinks my review is getting too long so i have to keep this one short. All you have to know is that the devs are very generous with rewards. They also had some issues and delays in the past so all new players will be rewarded with 40 FREE card packs right from the start, which is a massive help. Now to quickly finish thing off there are some things i either forgot to mention or just didn't mention because others did like 10 times before me. Very fun game, may take some time to learn but it's well worth it."
"Played this game everyday for over a month on a PC emulator. It's a great Hearthstone-like game. I prefer the art in Shadowverse however, and the prevelance of board clears and the existence of the evolve mechanic means that more decks are viable compared to HS. These aspects coupled with the lack of RNG bull make this my digital TCG of choice. Doesn't hurt that it is also very F2P friendly. Try it and you'll probably like it."
Very easily accessible game. Cards are very easy to come by so a decent deck can be made within the first day or two of play. Stronger decks can be created in a week or two of play. Interface is not the best but it is acceptable.
"This merits my first review ever. Game is amazing, so many different decks are viable. Don't let the art style push you away, it dissuaded me at first, but I'm so glad I tried it because it quickly became my current favorite game and definitely favorite CCG by far. The devs are attentive, there is so much support, events and free cards given just to promote the community on a regular basis. It's entirely possible to play to Master without spending a dime but with the fantastic support the game receives you'll find yourself willing to spend just to support the kindness. What are you waiting for? It costs nothing to try. Thank the devs later."
"P2W vs Hearthstone: Either very (generous / heinous). Booster packs are somewhat 'fair', with rates for each card revealed officially. Many bronze/silver tier cards are viable. However there are 2~3 really powerful class legendaries that you (want to / have to) stuff the deck with full three copies for serious jump in win rates - Game allows you to buy the same starter deck three times for that reason more or less.Gameplay: Some matchups can be very stagnant. They do their own thing, you do yours, and maybe once every three turns Haven and Rune will react to your turn. Hell, if the game let them do it, I'm sure they'd throw single target removals against an empty board out of force of habit. Aggro Swordcraft floods the board every turn and doesn't care how you deal with it, but at least there is a war of attrition to be fought there. In the end everything is balanced because everything is OP, sort of. Except poor fairies, combo system isn't friendly to them yet.Audiovisual: You're playing this instead of Hearthstone because of dem waifus. Illustrations are large enough to appreciate them as CCGs tend to be.Overall: Nice distraction, probably worth investing a few starter decks, good fun being in the middle of the pack playing suboptimal decks, but the climb to top isn't appealing."
"Weeaboo hearthstone but is more balanced and nearly no RNG.  Classes feel more like separate entities than in hearthstone due to their specific mechanics.  Evolve is an interesting mechanic that takes the place of hero powers that I find more interesting overall and doesn't limit a classes power inherently.  If you are sick of hearthstone try this game, in my opinion it is better overall. (I've played this game a lot on phone before its PC release)"
"I got the game out of curiosity, but its surprisingly good. The graphics are astonishly beautiful, and the animations are all right too. The cards look good and some of them is worth a glimpse or too. The card game seems to be well balanced, you can have fun with it, and later you want to play more. It does not feel like grinding, and the stories are well built up. It is recommended to play through all the character stories for more reasons, like learning how the decks work, and to understand what is going on exactly. In each story, I have encountered an enemy that was too strong to defeat on first try and needed to play a few times to achieve victory. I used the basic story deck, but you can create a completely new one and use that in the story mode. You can even link the game to your mobile phone, to play portable. The game surprises you with good bonuses and with the holidays here you get even more, which I felt really appreciated. Pros:- Nice graphics and animations- Story looks interesting- Nice bonuses- No griding feeling yet- You donâ€™t have to spend real money to build up some decent decks- Can be linked to mobile- Has active multiplayer- Own decks can be built and customized easily- Frequently upcoming new contentsCons:- Each story mode has a difficult enemy on later stage (this is fine for me)- After completing almost all the stories you can get annoyed of the conversations you already heard- Decks can be sometimes confusing- Multiplayer can be hard, but you need to try regardless- The extra evolution point for the 2nd player seems to be a big advantage"
"The gameplay of Hearthstone meets the exploitable mechanics of Magic: The Gathering in this pay-to-win masterpiece! If you enjoy having your turn skipped three times in a row while gigantic golems pound your face in, or unstoppable demons incinerating the board and your face every single turn, or a Doctor Who-esque angel statue sitting on the field until it automatically wins the game, then this is the collectable card game for you!"
"If you like playing punchy well balanced TCGs whilst masturbating furiously to japanese cartoons, this is the game for you.Seriously, it's pretty good. At least as much care and attention has been put into the game itself, as it has into depicting the bewbs. And that's a lot of care and attention."
"It's a fun and addictive card game, for both hardcore and casual enjoyers alike. With effort, you can get a great experience without spending any money, however if you can afford it, it may be worth a few bucks for either some card packs or even some fun optional stuff like fancy customization. I noticed last expansion it took them a bit too long to nerf stuff that made the game unbalanced but they seem to have done much better with the new Wonderland one, which doesn't seem to present any major problems or inbalances as I can tell. It's really cool cuz cards are voiced, some by cool voice actors. You can change the language of the voice acting too if you want. Also the card art is freaking gorgeous and awesome. As an art nerd it's one of my favourite parts. I also really like how basically any deck is obtainable with enough effort. Any card is craftable, though of course the better ones take some effort. It's cool how there are so many class types, and how each one has not only different mechanics but different ways to play the decks. You'll need strategy to win, especially with a variety of opponents all with varied strategies themselves. Fun and clever! I really reccomend it."
This game has potential but if playing the Ai is any foreshadow of how things will be against other players I will pass. It was frustrating not being able to complete the story mode cause the AI just ran you over again and again. I'm sure there were some who had no problem at all but for me it just became a huge grind so back to hearthstone I went.
"really, really love this game. this game is nearly similiar to heartstone in some aspects but in my opinion shadowverse is better. the developer is not so money oriented. lot of the meta deck is a low-cost budget deck. so a f2p can enjoy this game better than heartstone IMO"
"Hello, avid tcg player here who has played almost every card game to date intensively and at top level. Here is my verdict for Shadowverse after having played in A+ tier every day for over 1 month. First of all, I am writing this review because I feel that Shadowverse is extremely overrated. You can tell by other reviews that the people reviewing it have either barely played it OR do not have full knowledge of all the existing card games out there, how much luck is involved in them vs requiring actual strategy, and how stale the gameplay is at top tier level (meaning the amount of viable decks that you can play with + cards which you can tech into them). I feel like a lot of people are giving this game too much credit due to the seemingly generous introduction which the game offers, giving you 40 packs right off the bat. The negatives are also not noticeable at low tier ranked games (B and below), so everything seems great right? To be fair, I would've written a positive review for this game aswell early on. But I stuck around for the long haul, and boy am I disappointed with it. The following bit will cover the key parts of the gameplay which makes me give this game a negative review.!!!!!Going second has too many advantages!!!!!So there are some stat nerds who just love to throw ""but going first had 60% win rate before the changes, it's much better now!"" in your face when you state this fact, but what they do not realize is that Darkness Evolved introduced a bunch of cards which made going second on par for every leader with going first already tempo/combo wise. Not only that; it also opened up new combos with the base cards which makes those super aggro decks not viable to play at all now @top tier. This set was either barely released or yet to be released when the 60% win rate for going first was determined, when Cygames made these changes which now heavily benefits the person going second. Here are the advantages for going second:-You draw an extra card-You get 1 more evolution orb (crucial for turning the game around)-You get to evolve first (this is the gamebreaking part)But that's not all. I mentioned that this game is very stale when it comes to strategic options. For anything other than super aggro *go straight for the leader* deck builds, there are barely any cards in most top tier constructed decks which let you make full use of your play points every turn, which is vital for going first. That crucial turnaround extra evolution which the player going second gets turns into a flat out advtantage already if there is nothing to turn around. As an example of a game phase, it's going to be very hard as the player going first already if you don't start with a 1 point cost card @turn 1.And not only that, the advantages of going first also get negated by plenty of instant impact cards (which do something the turn that you play them) and turn the match into player going 2nd's favour early on already. Few examples are:-Elf Child May (cost 1, does 1 damage to opponent follower, 1/1 field presence, forest)-Sylvan Strike (cost 2, deal 2 damage to opponent follower, put 1/1 fairy in hand, forest)-Whole-Souled Swing (cost 2, deal 2 damage to opponent follower, spawn 1/1 knight on field if you have less creatures on field than opponent when playing this card - this is always the case when going 2nd and playing vs aggro, sword)-Magic Missile (cost 2, deal 1 damage and draw a card, rune)-Kaleido (cost 2, return a 2 point cost or less card to the owners hand and draw a card, rune)-Fire Lizard (cost 2, deal 1 damage to opponent follower, 2/1 field presence, dragon)-Blazing Breath (cost 1, deal 2 damage to opponent follower, dragon)-Angelic Barrage (cost 3, deal 1 damage to all opponent followers, all decks)Cards like these will prevent player 1 from having any kind of advantage, since there is a severe lack of instant impact early game (turn 1-4) cards available right now. Quickblade (sword) is ok but can be dealt with too easily, Wolf works well due to the nature of the deck that it is used in + stats of other cards (hope and pray for no Angelic Barrage if all field presence = 1 defence), and Pinion/Aria's amulet status + a countdown reduction card like Dogma allows for a strong start if you're not playing vs Runecraft like:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822418799Normally, if opponent decides to take out all of your creatures with theirs, you'll have 1-2 remaining on the field by the end of turn 3 and maybe did a few points of damage to them. But then they get to evolve and put up one of those 4 cost power cards; a strong creature like Floral or Bishop. This curve suits 2nd player too perfectly with the play points vs cost of those cards, and being in a situation where you can use them since evolved creatures have Rush (can attack opponent creature on the same turn). The only cards for player going first which can deal with this evolved creature on turn 5 = Dance of Death, Demonic Strike, Will of the Forest (forest leader only), 2 storm cards (gives opponent 2 for 1 value though), + a few more 3+ insta damage cards. Almost none of these cards are used x3 in any deck so the odds of you having them in your hand at that moment = low. So, you will likely be forced into evolving one of your own creatures to take it out because your opponent will likely be able to retain field control + do damage every turn and finish the game at turn 7-8 if you don't.Atm, the complete opposite goes for player going first if they also have such cards in their hand. They either have to waste a turn if they don't have anything else in their hand which they can play (remember they have 1 card less, so less to pick from) OR play a card like Fire Lizard/Healing Angel without being able to make use of its effect (no creature on opponents field, no use for healing early on since your opponent hasn't started to damage you yet and is focusing on keeping their life as high as possible + trying to keep field control equal until they can activate advantage of their evo power card which the game is currently offering by letting them evolve first). All power evolve cards cost 4 or 3 points though, so you will likely waste 1 play point here (having a 1 cost card to fill it up with at this point woudn't even be desired) aka it won't be a perfect curve.Storm/insta damage cards let you sort of bypass this because they'll atleast do some damage to your opponent before being removed, which lets you work towards barely getting your opponents life down to 0 which will likely cost you all of your cards to do so aswell, and then rip if opponent has sufficient heals or throws up a ward if you only have a storm card left in your hand. And that is why Bloodcraft is currently the only succesful deck which can still manage to go first without being gimped under these circumstances.Past the mid point of the game, there is only one thing you can hope for if the early game hasn't been in your advantage: You drawing into those big late gameish gold/legendary cards while your opponent draws into weak (at that stage of the game) early game cards which don't provide enough resistance or damage to deal with said gold/legendary cards. If it doesn't happen then you just flat out lose. So basically that comes down to pure luck, which is too big a factor in the game atm. There is less luck involved with Poker than with this game right now; and you know that a tcg is bad when that is the case. Tcgs should always have more strategy involved than with Poker, which is known as the game where luck matters most. So the Shadowverse ""About this game"" description stating that this is the most tactically rich CCG on the market is just a big lie.See comments for closing words."
"If I had to describe Shadowverse for me... it's like that abusive relationship you just can't seem to get out of it. You know the gacha is salty. You know the grind is real. You know it eats away at you. You know it is pay to win. You know the battles are excruciatingly frustrating.  You know there is some SERIOUS balancing issues. Yet, I'm still masochistic enough to keep going with the relationship. It's just only on the outside the relationship looks pretty with the art and voices.Okay. Truthfully, if you like this kind of card games with an anime art, then go ahead and play. It can't hurt to try. But It's mainly RNG in the battles and the packs. RNG to get the right cards you need to win or counter. So I guess the only strategy is playing with cards you're given with if you didn't get a good spread or if both players get ideal spread. But really when your opponent can get all the necessary cards in 4 turns there is something wrong. It's not strategy in my opinion. Some people say the rate for legendaries (highest rarity) are high, but note that you need 3 of the same copies and sometimes multiple legendaries. Same goes for gold (second highest rarity). You can get crap legendaries and gold. Vials are not nearly enough to make a deck for the most part. So this is where the credit card comes out. If you want go ahead and spend money, then it's your choice. With that said, I'm not sure how in the world someone who is starting and F2P going to catch up to 6 expansion packs? You also need a working deck for every lead, so that's a lot of cards. I mean when you do get a semi-solid deck with all the necessary cards it can be kind of enjo- Anyways, the relationship without a doubt is pretty tough. F2P good luck and those willing to pay go on ahead and play and have fun.  "
"TL;DR New player friendly, Game is filled with fast aggro decks, don't play if you like slow control/for fun decks.Alright. This game is great for new players. Tons of free card packs, tons of events that give additional rewards, game itself is simple and difficult to master, blah blah blah. Typical card game.I love the game, I could play the decks I wanted to play within a few weeks of completing quests and opening packs. Climbing ranks is viable even for new players.Despite all of these positives, the current game state since the release of the last two expansions: Wonderland Dreams and Starforged Legends makes playing the game feel more like a chore. Aggro decks rule the ladder and people like me who want to play slow control can't have fun. If that suits you, go for it."
"Back when the game was released on Steam it used to be an interesting concept with nice looking art and lots of free packs to keep the player entertained without having to pay anything and remain competitive which made the game popular in certain circles. As time went on it became duller and duller since there wasn't much strategy other than drawing the right cards or playing aggressively and preying on the opponents bad luck. But we accepted it and expected the game to expand and fix itself. (God, how innocent we were)Time went on and contrary to everyone's expectations they didn't fix the core problem of the game and just added more powercreeps just to nerf them (or at least part of it) after a couple of months later leaving the terrible aftertaste of what is this game about anymore or what can we expect from the future. Of course it just got worse with the time until everyone that had a slight chance of interest on it gave up and went away.To summarize the game it's basically a heavily luck based, go first, curve it out and dominate sort of play with a few exceptions that are barely playable these days. The comeback factor is very flimsy as you probably can count in your hand the times you really felt like you actually used a smart strategy to fool your opponent and get the best of it. No opponent hand destruction, no traps, no control mechanics at all. Drop followers (minions, creatures etc) and do your worst that's the game. Also plenty of spells can deal damage to the player health so you can exploit that too. The absurd amount of cheap kills and highly annoying cards that can snowball your game or just dumb stuff that can simply autowin when played (ahem, Eachtar) only makes Shadowverse a terrible and stressful experience either when you win or when you lose. No balance allowed! must be their motto. Most of the time you simply get a better hand go face (player health) and the opponent concedes. The card game feel is completely nonexistent and it feels like a grinder, a cute anime girl parade grinder. Exactly like, you know, those puzzle block games you meddle around with your smartphone for quick time killing brainless fun... which is exactly what the devs always wanted this game to be from the very beginning if you read their interviews. Guess we just had the wrong expectations from this (?) who knows.Anyway, let it rot. All the time I wasted on this wasn't worth at all and surely the same will be true for you. Go play something else, really. You've been advised."
"I've seen complaints about meta being too fast, i'm climbing with a control deck right now.  Currently at A2.  a lot of people dont understand the concept of changing their deck if something doesnt work.  The game has everything i love about a ccg, mainly creating non meta decks to compete in the meta."
"Quality graphics,Handful of waifu babes,Easy to play,Not so much rng,Plenty of bonuses,But NOT balanced!Why the **** is there a card in the game called Heavenly Aegis?!A card that has literally only 2 ways that can somehow deal with it's effect.1/10 rating,Pay to win."
"This game started out really promising, but took a pretty awful turn in the past 9 months or so. The people designing the cards just seem to have so much trouble keeping them balanced.For reference to how bad the problem of unbalanced overpowered cards became, the devs announced that they were going to do monthly balance changes not too long ago. I know a lot of people agree with the idea, but a full release card game that people put real money into, where you release an expansion every THREE months needs balance changes every SINGLE month? You need to keep changing things even after a single nerf wave following an expansion? It's a bit of a testament to how bad their balance philosophy is; they change powerful cards just make other cards even more unbalanced. It's completely out if hand and a little overwhelming, to be honest. They also do these really strange and out of place crossovers, like with street fighter. Kind of just wish they could have kept the integrity of the standalone universe. But that's a personal preference. I don't know why you'd bother playing this game instead of the other more polished options. There's not enough of a difference from Hearthstone to really call it unique or preferable.Art is top notch though, easily my favorite part of the game."
"The game plays exactly like Hearthstone now. It's all luck in terms of going first or second, match ups, and curving. So if you're the type of player who enjoys winning or losing games for reasons beyond your control, this game is for you."
"Blind fanboys will write a long essay to defend the game so there isn't a point writing this. Read selias and aeonstars review if you want to know more. Played on phone, it was good before but gets worse every expansion. Balancing a game isn't just about tweaking OP cards which cygames need to realise. The game is essentially a brainless scissors paper stone grind. Control is dead, aggro storm is uninteractive, a game filled with broken cards. If you like games that doesn't require much thought where face is the place, sure, this is for you. Otherwise, play duelist, gwent or fairae instead."
"This game is by far the most unbalanced card game i have ever played. if you are looking for games with actual rules to make interesting gameplay mechanics happen, feel like you have achieved anything at all aside from opening 50 PACKS after the tutrial???? wtf?? sounds great right? wrong. this makes everyone have absurd cards and just remake accounts until they get what they want. uncommons can give you 5 mana for a 13/13.... uh.. if everything is that powerful, there's a huge slope in the game when you go against someone that just can't be thwarted. going first has such an aggressive push since the opponent can attack the player rather than the units and unlike hearthstone, all the big crazy units that everyone already owns makes it no fun at all. I will say the storyline idea was good and the attempt at a choose 2 of the 4 cards draft was interesting. but. the lack of balance makes this game by far crap..Try Eternal Card Game, Hearthstone, Magic the gathering, or something of the sort, because all of those games hold more hope than this game will in a long time."
"Pros:- Free, why not give it a try?- Interesting card system, I personally like to experience new system and see how they work- Well drawn art style- Voice over not only for dialogs but cards alsoCons:I don't have a problem with free to play games in general. I had spend many many hours in Guild war 2, Planetside 2 and other F2P game. However, the way this game push its monetisation just leave a bad taste in my mouth. You start with crappy cards obviously, which is not really an issue at first. Then the difficulty ramps up and you hit a brick wall which no amount of skill will carry you through. You see, the card game mechanics is interesting, but it is not as flexible a system as say, magic the gathering. If the opponent's cards are much stronger than yours and/or their type of deck counter yours, eg:Rush deck vs your slow deck or AoE deck vs your creature spam. There is simpily no way to win without getting more powerful cards and/or redesigning your deck entirely, which also need more cards.Obviously, this is to push you into spending money on buying cards. However, when I hit a brickwall that no amount of skill can get me through, I am obviously feeling♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rubbing salt in my wound by showing an elaborated, unskippable animation of me losing AND then shoving in my face ""Do you want to spend $$$ and WIN?????"" prompt is just going to make me even more annoyed.TLDR: Game is worth a try for novelty sake, although you will notice its limitations fairly quickly and the monetisation modal is probably going to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off."
"Installed the game: After the second tutorial mission I get ""Error code 100"" and can't continue.Alright, no big deal, just google it; Apparently very few other people are having this problem. The one suggestion I got was to clear cache/reinstall. Okay, done. Error code 100.Fine, this time I'll just put in a support ticket. Fill out my ticket, give them my PC specs etc. THE ♥♥♥♥ING SUPPORT TICKETING SYSTEM IS BROKEN! It says I need to fill in a date and time when 1) this isn't a required field on the page, and 2) I ALREADY HAVE FILLED IN THE DATE AND TIME AND IT JUST WON'T ACCEPT IT FOR NO REASON!I even tried to contact them on Facebook but they won't even let you contact them through Facebook! I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥ing tilted right now if I'm honest. Can't recommend a game where the tutorial is broken and you can't contact them about it."
"The game is beautifull and clever (cards have great artworks, the decks have mechanics that are interesting), but overall it's not a fun experience to play: - Matchmaking is horrible (you are put up against players way above your skill level, even in ""ranked"", which strikes me as a bad design/decision) and offputting;- Only other option is to play against AI which have 2 difficulties - Extremely easy (boring to play against) AND Advanced (even if you are about to win the bots will topdeck whatever card they need to turn the match around and destroy you), so there isn't a middle ground there;- The storyline is Okay i guess, but the majority of cards, which are voiced, are MOANING LOLIES, which might be annoying to a lot of players;- There are some neat features like free daily prizes and condolence prizes if you lose (trust me, that will happen ever so often, unless you're a veteran player or/and cashing-in microtransactions to get the rare-er cards);- I've tried a lot of card games on steam, most of them were boring and uninspired, but this one got me hooked for a while, but there are lots of things that made me reconsider that decision, so i will not be sticking around- The game is OK as PvE experience; PvP is horrible;"
"Had the game since release. Loved it. Moved from Iphone to android, account deleted. Moved from Android to PC? account deleted. I'm tired of wasting my time re-grinding because this game can't properly connect to facebook."
"I liked this game at first. Coming from Hearthstone this was a fresh change while also being familiar. I got fairly high up the ranks, built a couple of decent decks and was generally having a decent time until I got to the p[oint where every opponent I faced had legendary after legendary, and losing just wasn't fun. One of the characters has a card so you lose your next turn for example, and I find that kind of thing incredibly boring.The final straw came because this game comes with stuff that likes to run in the background at all times too and I don't like that kind of thing, especially if I've paid for content and supported the devs/publisher. Leeching my bandwidth that I pay a premium for is unacceptable, and whether it's spyware or not I don't care. I will never NEVER support this dev or publisher again."
"Gonna cut it short,Unbalanced as hell, except if you invest tons of cash into cards, then you can just spamm legendarys in win.In order to get some ingame currency you can either play against other players (for less) or complete the story that isnt balanced. I just wasted 4 Houers in order to complete the 8th stage of the story, just to get 11th one where i wasted another 3 houers while not winning.The game tells me to use a starter pack (that i must buy from the shop, with real money) in order to susceed.And honestly who the damn though that it would be a good idea to change between too easy bosses and then random End bosses, without any information. Its Impossible for me (except without investing ingame money for cards or starter packs) to beat the story, i wont even bother with the Multiplayer mode."
"Very Good Game overall, but do not dig too much into it.Do not recommend it for now.I consider this game one of the best for a low-end computer, while it brings more fun than many other games.Pros- It feels good to pay for some game content including card packs and accessories, since the developers seriously paied for the art and the smooth animation. It runs 60fps too.Definitely not some crap games that makes you pay $10 to shoot a deer. Every card is carefully designed to a degree that they are good by themselves. (probably not fairies, but they don't go to your collection right?) Technically not a pay-to-win game at least in the first few months. What to do?Melt all other cards for 1 or 2 battle deck, then you are set with only luck matters.But at the next release patch you probably need to buy cards again...Cons-This game is swarmed with Asian. well i am an Asian too, I am just considering Asian commuity very committed to make decks for the win. As a result you probably run into similar weird opponents extremely often (such as low cost necro, [Yui Chan's voice is the best!]) and get crashed with a normal-style deck.Developers aren't smart with money farming. They leave some SSR cards with bugged stats so people go buy them for win. Of course that bug will be fixed and the money would be wasted for many people.Ultimately a pay-to-win game requring long term investiment. Your deck is severely limited if you paid too little (I do not complain about paying, you need to know how to pay to let people make you good games).Large investiment usually brings frustration in card games, so be careful.----Some usless suggestions----Developers could make weekly subscription decks so people would shuffle their cards just for fun. Make Co-op Raids, Just like GranBlueFantasy, with player teams dualing with Raid Boss. With an entraince ticket (from take-two?). for a reward of some vials or even special cards.wish it's helpful."
it'd be the best online card game available because of the godlike arts in it if it wasn't for the fact that most of them are censored to appeal to mentally challenged 'murican SJWs f*** CyGames
"if you like to die in turn 5 this game for you! , so much cancer aggro decks that use no brain and broken cards , hearthstone suddenly looks x100 better than this hot garbage , my dream is to have card game that subscription fee each month and give you all cards without worring about whales"
"Don't listen to the bad reviews; as they are mostly:- cry babies- attention seekers - trolls (muh hearthstone iz betur scrubscribe to bizzaro pls)- bad players (where is hunter me go face??? bad game if me no go face) (pro tip: there is a lot of face decks, casuals.)- short attention span people A.K.A doesn't pay attention of the ennemy turn, then get 2TKO/OHKO and then cries on reviews.- lazy players that won't read the cards.- lazy ♥♥♥♥s that won't understand gameplay mecanics of the game.- people that assume weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥= bad (yeah u so cool man oh geez please hang with me i wanna be your bro friend)the salt is over, lets begin the true review.This game is pretty much awesome. It has a long solo story mode that gives plenty of rewards and plenty of salt if you don't know how to play later on.Shadowverse isn't your typical TCG, as its way harder (20HP. crying on hearthstone because you die too fast? you will LOVE this game. easy 2TKOs in most of the decks or OHKOs if you have the right setup.) way more salty (enjoy fighting someone with 40 legendaries on his deck. as you only have 2 on your deck.) and way much confusing (a ♥♥♥♥ ton of actives/passives/combos/♥♥♥♥ery in the cards)We're not talking about balance here, because there is quite a lot of combos to do its confusing. but if you have game knowledge, proper understanding on what your deck is and how to deal with ennemies; you can win.This game is either get salty or git gud son... or both, just like me.TL;DR: waifu game with a lot of cards that makes people salty cause you can get ohko/2tko easely. Great solo story mode, very generous start (50 decks and a lot of currency) so that you can reroll if you don't have good stuff (8 cards per deck. thats a lot of cards trust me.) only downside is just like all the other TCGs, default decks are VERY bad. make your own or stop crying.10/10"
"This game has promise, interesting play styles, gorgeous artwork, and a voice acted short story mode.Problems? Story mode, which is designed for you to get to know each craft, or deck playstyle (almost like a class system) has drunk the unnecessarily hard ai Kool-Aid brought on by dark souls. Prepare to be given a pre-made deck that has the class basics but none of the advanced cards while facing an ai who has advanced or expert versions of their own decks. This makes the tip of ""play of other leaders to understand their playstyle"" that pops up if you lose a duel useless. Oh, you can't modify these story mode decks so you will understand the meaning of insanity if you make it through all of what the story mode offers.I have done up to Luna 7th duel where she faces Eris. Problem? Eris is the perfect counter to my deck. Everything I do, she has a counter to. Oh she has a monster that will be summoned in 4 turns? Too bad because anything you summon to bull rush her will get banished or she will flood the field with shield monsters so punishment for her over-extensions are non-existent. Then the horrible hands and rng. Good lord. A beautiful game that is ruined by unnecessary difficulty. Especially since the focus is on multiplayer but I guess us peons who wanted to get the basics before diving in are sol. Another steam card game to uninstall and forget this beautiful mess exists.If you are an masochistic player, then this game was made for you. "
"Expansion > Balance . That is what Cygame thinking, they just focusing on milking money out of them anime ti**ies . Each expansion is another let down, better play some other card game out there. About game play, just build your deck with half 2 drop cards, play on curve, go for face and win, doesn't need brain work at all."
"Starforged Legends: Another new meta ruined by non-interactive deck archetypes because of obviously broken cards that should never have been printed in their current form. Despite claiming that they would not design cards like this anymore, Cygames continues to do so. Rune, Forest, Dragon, and Sword are all now fielding decks that either go straight for the face with turn 6 storm lethal or they play severely undercosted cards that simultaneously clear the opponent's board and generate face damage. Cards that have been design space problems since their release (i.e. roach, Sibyl) continue to be the backbone of degenerate decktypes because Cygames refuses to nerf them. While Cygames claims that the game is becoming more balanced due to equalizing win/loss ratios, the reality is that this is only happening because games are increasingly decided by the luck of the draw: with cards like this, every game simply snowballs out of control. Almost all decision-making skill elements are gone from the game."
"Ok, I am in a mood for some card games or something like that. I like collecting stuff and puzzle, strategy etc. games in general. So I tried this one. I will start with my initial difficulties and problems, then I will mention what I like and then why I don´t want to play anymore.It has only 100 MB? Cool. Ok, so it´s downloaded. Oh wait, now it started downloading additional stuff... 30 minutes later... Ok. Why can´t I turn this on full screen? Oh, on the forums they say that is possible only after completing the tutorial... Why? Let´s play. Oh wait, I changed my mind. I want English subtitles and Japanese voice acting... Oh, you cannot change that either until you finish tutorial. Uninstall and once more all the patching. Ok, now we can play... Now I want to know what English VAs sound like. Oh, they download the audio pack every time you change it...I like how addicting the gameplay can get. The art, the voices and music are all amazing. The game could use some quality of life changes (by that I mean it should behave like it´s on PC, some parts are unnecessarily clunky). And then we get to the core of the issue. Since it´s F2P (hey, they got to make money somehow, I am not disputing that) there are various cosmetic and also non-cosmetic items to buy with multiple currencies, some of which can be bought for real money. You get seemingly generous amount of packs for free for the start. You also get some cards at the start of the game. The issue with that is the number of factions these card packs are linked to. So you are not going to get all that many for one faction. Add to that the possible doubles and special coll looking animated cards, which add even more chance of doubles. It is card collectible, so you either pay or grind (and wait), or something in between. The learning curve is quite steep. You have very little knowledge about strategy, synergies (due to the sheer number of cards your opponents pull out of their asses). The simple fact is the longer you play the better variety of cards and strategies (and also you can actually put together a complete deck which you kind of can´t at the start).In the end, this leads to you battling people who are more experienced, have better cards and complete decks and who use stuff you do not yet know exists until it hits your face (which can end in your sudden defeat in like two turns). I look at the other reviews saying the RNG is not that bad here, however in my eyes it is still insane. Your opponent can have a lot of (for you) new things. Add to this few multiplayer battles the singleplayer journey, which is cool but still mostly a series of set pieces for battles (where you can face again complete decks with your incomplete one), the usual daily logins and shiny unpacking... Oh yeah and the story translations are a bit off (I know enough Japanese for me to say that myself).I do not hate this game, in fact I would like to love it quite a lot. I just can´t. The initial difficulties, the trappings of the infinite F2P and the vision I would have to spend dozens of hours over the course of many days to even get few decent decks for more than one faction just make me conclude my time could be better spent elsewhere. I can see why people like it. I for myself cannot recommend it. It´s free though, so try it for yourselves."
No real strategy in this game. The rare and legendary cards are so powerful that you just have to stack them in your deck to overpower any threat thrown at you. I shouldnt have expected anything more from a f2p game.
Caught in an endless disconnection while trying to patch the game. There are work arounds online at a significantly slower rate but this is unacceptable. Have fun y'all. I'll just play Hearthstone.
"Incredible game. Generous. But often has connectivity issues on the steam version, which the mobile version doesn't have. There have been tons of posts on steam regarding this, but Cygames still hasn't fixed the issue. Can't recommend the game until this has been resolved."
"IT IS HEARTHSTONES BUT WITH WAIFUS!!!! Only down side to this game is that meta decks are the most prominant thing ever, if u se one efficient deck, you will see the same efficient deck a thousand times untill meta changes... But over all just playin story and stuff is fun. Soooo i recomend!!"
I play this game and I am TRYING my best to enjoy it. Pros - Amazing art design for their cards. Lots of beautiful asthetics.Loads of cards with expansions coming out regularly so you have plenty of decks to choose from.Story mode is quite engaging and has plenty of rewards for early players so they can get startedThey give you loads of booster packs to begin with so you can actually get a deck going for yourself so they offer quite a lot to new players.Cons - Despite everything they do for new players. You will be having to put money into the game to even start winning any games. They do give you loads of boosters to start but that does NOT mean they will give you cards that you can work with. Because of the different classes in cards your decks will always be missing cards to them for the decks to even work. You run into constant players who have these clean cut decks filled with the cards they need to win or reach their win condition. I cannot see any new person coming into this game and getting anywhere when it comes to playing against other players. Good luck to those of you who struggle to make a deck and successfully do without spending money. Terrible match making. While doing some pvp I find myself battling against people who are double my rank which is completely insane!Repeatetive. Eventually after fighting against more and more players you'll find that each person will be running decks that are quite the same. Mostly brainless decks that they copy from someone else online so they can just run it and win. It gets boring pretty quickly. Despite all they do for new players. It is not enough. They also seem to pump out more and more expansions quickly which probably means this game is more of a cash grab since you will probably buy the packs just to stay relevant. I've had this game for months and I have not had 1 completed deck so far because I can never get the cards i need from the packs. There are far to many cards for all the different classes that you can't even use. It would be better if they sold boosters that were class specific.
"While the game can start out fun, once you play enough times you realize how poorly balanced it is. Going first vs going second is a sickeningly drastic disadvantage in card evolutions, card draw, and reaction power in a game not built around much OTK-style burst. If you only play a few hours of Shadowverse, you may enjoy it. Anything beyond that is just being a masochist."
"The most generous card game I know of, in regards to boosters, gold, and arena tickets. The meta is also constantly changing, with regular updates and balance changes, keeping the game fresh and encouraging experimenting with deck builds and new combo ideas. Never a dull moment. A good alterntive if you want to ditch the grind of another game. Also anime art!"
"I want to say good things about this game because art is really beautiful. Musics are good, and as a F2P game cardpacks are actually free.But game is unbalanced. In PvP arena you can see nearly everybody play as heavencraft. Heavencraft cards are OP. Especialy heavenly Aegis. This card have 8/8 and CAN'T BE DAMAGED. If you want to play this game and build a deck otherwise Heavencraft, stay PvE."
"Kinda meh card game... Story is okay, but gets to the point if you don't buy cards your not going to get further. Don't waste your time try another CCG as this one is just so forgetable it isn't worth the time.Edit: After Months away.. I went back to this game to see if it has improved. Unfortunetly it has not. The basic packs can be bought with gold, but not much else so there is not any chance to get unless you spend money. The princes are kinda messed up, and the new faction is not any good unless you get a lot of expensive cards.. Which means more money. This game has gone from meh, to just bad.. There are better games to spend your money on, and the free to play aspect is only there in a minimal fashion."
"This is my first card game and i have to say i love it. I can play it everyday and it's completely F2P. You can build up to 3 nice decks without spending money and farming some dailys. I recommend it to anyone, even if you are not into card games. I got into it because i find the card's anime-style art absolutely amazing and the game mechanics satisfying. I never thought I would like a card game so much. <3(Sorry for my english)"
"Really rather dull. I don't play many card games (MTG is really the only one i have ever tried) but this is not going to get me interested in playing more. Non-existent manual makes it tough to figure out what the hell all the things that are happening at lightning speed. I know it's out there somewhere, but if they are too stupid to link it in the game, I am not going to bother looking, I don't think it would help much, still a very stale game for  me. Not having much experience with them, I cannot really say whether more seasoned card game players will like it. Might be heaven for them."
"Pros:Easy to get into, free to play and free to win, cool artworksCons:Game balance is not so good, too much advantage on aggro, too much lolis I don't evenOverall, quite interesting to play. It's free anyway "
"Game is great content wise, unfortunlatley this game on the steam client is PLAGUED with bugs.This should not be listed as finished product. It's not good enough to port a mobile game.I have had so many issues:1) downloading the game: It worked for 1 day then bugged out and literally would not download the game data. 50+ reinstalls later and 10 hours of screwing around with it, I left it on overnight for another 10 hours and somehow It downloaded - Support cannot explain this - I have ZERO network issues with any other video streaming platforms or other games/applications. This alone makes me hesitant to spend/invest time. As support confirmed nothing they can do if this happens again and I'm [locked out] of my account2) The steam overlay just won't function/come up with shadowverse, hence I cannot purchase crystals or anythign in-game. I went into 15-20 other steam games/apps - they all work fine with overlay. I've NEVER had the steam overlay not work with a game - EVER. These problems with the game is infuriating. Because otherwise the actual gameplay is great.I want to support game. But I just cannot justify spending money (IF i even could!) and getting locked out or bugged out.Support is no help. Just tells you it's your network etc or gives you scripted troubleshooting answers. (Which it isn't!!) Shadowverse is BUGGED with steam. Massive Issues. Beware.I own many games on steam, but never have I had this much bug issues with a game ever."
"Looking for a new card game after Hearthstone, Magic Duels and Magic online, i tried Shadowverse.Starting out in the game you are rewarded with plenty new cards to try out, which is good. I jumped into ranked mode and tried playing other players. I discovered that (at the lowest level of the scale), I was only playing against decks filled with rare and legendary cards. Since i had no cards like these, i obviously had no chance at winning. With 20 years of playing diverse collectible card games, it is my opinion that i can build a decent deck with the cards provided.The game is is fairly simple in its mechanics. Easy to understand. If you are looking for a more complex game like Magic the Gathering, this is not the game for you. If you like Heartstone but are fed up with Hearthstone's randomness, this might be a game for you.Pro's:+ Easy to learn+ Rewards plenty of cards at the start of the game+ Logging in daily rewards you with some ingame items.Con's:- Probably needs some financial investment to be competitive- expensive cards overwhelmingly powerful- animations take too much time if you want to quit a match and start over. (which can't be turned off)"
"Update:Cards got nerfed, meta is more balanced now, it's more fun again. You still get plenty of free packs and aditional promo packs from time to time. Cygames is really generous with their free stuff, which makes this probably the most free to play-friendly CCG right now. With two of the power cards nerfed, deck building got somewhat meaningful again, it's just generally a much more fun experience again.If you seek a more japanese-ish CCG with expansions every 3 months and a dark fantasy atmosphere but with minimal RNG involved, this is the perfect fit for you!"
"I wanted to like this game. Afterall, I've been playing Hearthstone for a while now so I should be able to enjoy another card game like Shadowverse. Sadly, that is not the case. So far I've finished main story on forestcraft and dabble on few chapters of all the other craft. And already I'm having this sinking feeling about this game.The most important thing about a card game is balance. Which is, understandably very hard to achieve. Especially when suits in your company is badgering the developing team to push out more cards and sales. Either way, about 5 chapters into swordcraft, I'm starting to notice some terrible design choices such as the amulet. Amulet, what seems to me like a class of card virtually untouchable may sometimes carry terrible consequences. The problem is, unlike hearthstone, for which the dev clearly stated and showed their intention to design a game with interaction in mind (i.e: such as avoiding putting a card too op that the opposing player would lose for sure once the card enters the field and doesn't have time to respond), the Amulet in Shadowverse clearly is one of the poorly designed cards. I just don't see how cards like Heretical Inquiry or Death Sentence could possibly made it through testing and into public. They're cost 2 and 4 respectively and only takes 1 turn to come into effect. And considering the fact that you can't just attack an amulet directly, once opponent plays that card it's pretty much goodbye board and gg.In Hearthstone, while nobody sane could say that luck is never part of the game, there is enough options that a skilled player could time his offense and defense so that they win more than they lose. Looking at cards like amulet, I can't help but feel that the same options is missing here.TL;DR: If you want to see some neat art and card animation but doesn't care much for balance, give this game a try. But if you're serious card game player and want a balanced card game to fill your time, I'd still recommend Hearthstone over Shadowverse."
"I've only played a short while so far, but what I can say thus far is that - if you can put up with occasionally over-the-top and edgy artwork - the gameplay is solid and actually has some very interesting and new mechanical ideas, viz. the evolve mechanics which allow you to (generally) empower a creature and the Storm ability (think MtG Haste) versus Rush (Haste but only able to attack creatures, aka ""followers"" - this ability is also given by evolve). The result of these mechanics is a healthy amount of counterplay options, versus say Hearthstone and its numerous competitors. Another of the strongest aspects of this game is the relative generosity of the publisher: 10 free packs for every previous expansion and 10 free packs of the new one upon release. With login rewards of gold currency and card pack tickets in addition to daily quests that provide much the same, at no point have I felt at a complete disadvantage, even at only 4 hours in.As to the meta, I can't speak much to that because of my relative lack of experience. However, I began playing this in the previous, much-bemoaned patch and have played some with the new one and I will tentatively say that I have seen a greater variety of decks already.Considering these various aspects, it's worth a try if you're into virtual CCGs, I think. Cheers, all!"
"Beautiful artwork on all of the cards, and they are generous with cardspacks and ingame money, so you dont have to pay for cardpacks if you dont want to. The game seem to go a lot faster then other cardgames, so you wont get bored waiting for your opponent thinking forever. The adventuremode is pretty fun, and you can choose to have the language in japanese, and text in english."
"Id wish steam review could count my hours and money ive put into the IOS app, as because it was on IOS it was very easy for me to play at work etc. i enjoyed this game HARD for non RNG elements, since i came from hearthstone, which i played since alpha. For some reason, each every company comes out with an ""alice cluster"" the cardgame goes massively down hill, as with since wornder land dreams. it's all agro decks now, cygames has taken a new aproach to balance to legendaries post wonderland by making about 90% of them completely useless unplayable, the 2-3 that are competetive are absolutely busted. the new expansion is such a snooze fest, The new card art is so dull, prior to it, i loved the ghotic/ dark art style of the game, and excitingly looked forward to it each expansion, the art style after tempest of the gods is so horrendously hideous, i cant even pretend to be excited. Shadowverse is worth playing f2p, while it's increasingly narrowing to a ""NO FUN/ CREATIVITY ALLOWED"" playstyle. Dont waste your time and money on it."
"I believe i have more over than 250 hours in this game(play it on smartphone too). Used to like it and addicted at first, but the thrill stopped at A rank, where everyone and their dead grandparents use the same deck. A month before tempest of the gods expansion, i stopped playing. recently i installed this again in my brand new phone, new id, fresh start (at first i want to updating the game client on pc, and linked my account but for some reason the download bar didnt even move an inch)And boi, things just getting worse. Even in beginner rank people play the same damned deck, ""staircase to whatever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is"", multiple legendary card in BEGINNER rank, ""oh you killed my OP legendary, now let me play another copy of thatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥quot; in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing BEGINNER rankrerolling, smurfing and all thatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which is a nighmare for a real beginner.Now, you might think im rerolling and smurfing too, which is partly correct. but i just play with cards the game gave me, i dont even have a useful legendary, only a copy of skullfane and aurelia. which is outdated af, the gacha god hates me. sometimes i feel every card game developer didnt compare their newest expansion to their old card counterpart, nerf last expansion OP card, release a more op card. rinse and repeat."
"I've played several RNG games, and this is one of the best, would totally recommend!however, I really hope they increase the life when you reach a certain level, the levelling up feels kinda useless when It does absolutely nothing!"
"This is my favorite card game. Despite a lot of long time players complaning about it, I haven't found it as frustrating as they have. I believe the trick is to stay out of Masters to keep the game fun and exciting. So down at where I am which is about C1 there's a lot of decks you see on a daily basis. This is actually a result of the recent nerfs to Shadow and Dragon. Now, at least in my rank, it seems that almost every deck is somewhat viable. There are some things you have to know about this game and the mindset behind it. This is not Hearthstone. Hearthstone games can go way past turn 10, in this game, the devs made it so that the game should, hopefully end before turn 10 which is why so many people are complaining about OP cards. Yes those OP cards exist. No they're not designed to be unbalanced. They're designed to end games. So in a sense whoever has the upper hand while entering late game is at a big advantage.Another thing i want to talk about how this game differs from hearthstone since most shadowverse players converted from hs. Big differences: 3 copies of any card, 40 card decks, evolve, minimal rng, almost no board clear, and 20 HP faces. 3 copies of each card improves consistency by a lot. There's also almost no rng in this game except for deal X damage to a random enemy follower which when used strategically is not very rng at all. So in a way the game is much less random. As a result the plays are much more strategic. Top that with less board clear and you feel like you're actually playing a card game rather than a slot machine. In this game you're always playing towards a win condition whatever that may be and fortunately there's very few ways to turn the tables if you are severely losing unlike HS where one card can boardwipe and basically win you the game. No in this game the only cards that have that kind of power are win conditon cards which are typically 8+ mana. Why are players complaining? Well for like the last couple months there were only 2 viable decks. Everyone played them. If you play against the same deck in 80% of your games you'd probably be really bored. It was either play them or lose. Now it's better. For a player who likes playing for fun this is a great time to join. For a player who is super competetive idk. It's still probably better than HS tbh, but who knows how much. For new players. Alright so one bad thing is that this game has a bit of a diffculty cliff as a new player due to the abundant free cards you get early on. Does that sound like an oxymoron? Well as a new player who doesn't understand this particular game's meta you will probably have some trouble knowing what's good and what's bad just by looking at it. People who do know tend to reroll and end up with really strong decks at the start so prepare to feel the pain while you climb out of the noob hell. Don't climb too far though cause then you'll end up in Masters hell which is even worse. Stay in the safe zone, get some of the upcoming free packs, learn a bit, and make a deck based on what you like and be happy like me."
"If you like waifus, open 50 free packs of cards for complete the tutorial and waifus, this is your game.Is not hearthstone with waifus. Its better than hearthstone and it have waifus.Dont forget the waifus :vAnd if you dont have enough cards to build a deck you can play take two building a random deck choosing 2 of 4 random cards even if you dont have these."
"This is the best digital card game in the market.They have constant updates. The devs often listen to card balance requests. Their patches are transparent, giving the stats and explainations behind bufs or nerfs. New updates keep the game fresh.The art on the cards is fantastic and the animations to go with them are great too. If you like anime and card games then play shadowverse.The devs constantly do promotions and will give you packs if there are any server issues or major bugs. Making a deck may seem daunting because there are so many classes, but you can craft a viable deck with little time/money spent if you focus on one class at a time. I started this game before they had a rotation mode and still climb the ranks with an ok deck, Unlimited(mode where you can use every card to make a deck) and Rotation(standard/seasons) are both fun. The amount of goofy decks you can in unlimited stretch your imagination.I have quit all other digital card games since I have been playing this one,"
"The player matching algorithm is so bad it makes you don't want to play anymore, you can be playing against pro players that are in way higher leagues than you the first day you download the game. It is not friendly or pleasant to new players at all. Don't even bother."
"VERY EXPENSIVELIQUIFY VALUES ARE ATROCIOUSMagic the Gathering Arena has this game beat on vlaue, by 50%. I am able to have more viability in the 60 card decks i create in MTGA, than the 40 card decks in Shadowverse, for HALF THE MONEY."
"A hearthstone clone with a great ""manga style"" design : there are some good and new ideas on mechanics plays (like evolve), the different class are pleasant to discover and playing when you start.It's pleasant to start, because they give you many boosters.The interface on PC is not bad, but too similary to a android application.That's end the good part of my critics.It would be a great game, if only game developpers did'nt come crazy and create too many gamebreaker cards.The legendary cards, which you can have 3 exemplaries of the same in your deck, are too powerfull to be fun to play it or to play versus.The last extension ""Bahamut"" introduce some cards with totaly crazy power.  like seraphin statue (a havencraft card when destroyed return with a new incarnation, the fourth time it arrives, the havencraft player win the game) or like Daria, a runecraft creature who make draw 5 cards and reduce the cost of some drawed cards)At low lewel, in Versus game, you can play versus player who have already the tier 1 deck with : crazy runecraft who draw with extrem quickness their cards and play for 0 ""mana"" with a card who give them a new turn, the swordcraft or forestcraft who unleash hordes of creatures, too quickly to survives.In one year of existence, the game is at a so high madness level, which you can think that it will be very difficult to create some new cards which can't be like ""You win if you draw it"".In his developpment, this game seems to me very similar to a dead CCG from Ubisoft : Duel of champions : each new extention introduced more and more powerfull cards and if players wanted to play and won, they must bought many boosters from last extension to have the legendary.At this rate, in one year, i think and i fear that Shadowverse CCG will have the same issue than Duel of Champions. Closed and dead.I hope that game dev reacts quickly to correct their way or they fall."
"I tried to like Shadowverse, and it's still better than Hearthstone, but it's not great.Pros:-Nice Campaign mode-A few start-up packs-Animated character portraits-Everything's voiced-Evolve Mechanic to help recover from slow starts-More than 5 cards a pack-Potentially strong currency generation-Daily login bonus-Excellent motivation if you ever wish to commit suicide.Cons:-One Daily Mission slot is consumed by ""Link to another device"" by default. Steam version cannot link to another device, so players are denied a Daily slot.-Daily missions use the Hearthstone mandate of ""Win,"" making for a frustrating string of losses for classes people don't want to play. Only one mission may be rerolled a day.-BRUTAL demand for good cards and Hearthstone-esque crafting restrictions. People will restart entire accounts just to stand a chance with their initial draws.-No Matchmaking on Unranked.-Ranked becomes an invincible wall of meta decks as early as Beginner 2, making progression and income slow to achieve.-Strange emphasis and overvaluation of ""Take Two"", the Arena mode, which is five matches guaranteed, despite the appearance of being kicked out with no reward after one loss.-Immense RNG power. Imagine a set of fingers being smashed repeatedly with a hammer. That's what it feels like to have bad luck in this game."
"Haven't spent a penny and just from the free♥♥♥♥♥♥Cygames gives I'm running two meta decks and another 3 fun decks. Every expansion they give you a crapload of free♥♥♥♥♥♥by and far the best new player experience hands down and pretty good, responsive nerfs when needed. Not a steep learning curve but probably a little overbearing for newer players with the mechanics but the community on the steam fourms is extremely helpful and there is good youtube content avaliable as well as a growing subreddit /r/shadowverse  Play this game you probably wont regret it!"

"A very generous F2P game, the game looks at every opportunity to reward you with a plethora of missions and achievements. You can easily build a sizable collection without having to spend money.Gameplay is surprisingly balanced and the unique evolve mechanic really alleviates the ""starting 2nd"" problem most turn based games have. Each faction has specific conditions that you can build your decks around, but that doesn’t restrict your playstyle. Every faction has the potential to play aggro, mid-range, control or combo. There’s a lot of room to explore.Having played nearly every card game available, this is the only one that’s managed to keep me interested. What is Shadowverse? : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOGcPqH2GrE&t=42s "
"1 word, unbalanced.hearthstone got charge card with expensive cost or low health or hard requirmentshadowverse got normal card with charge effect for free without reductionthats 1 from many things that sucks about this gamejust go to hearthstonehearthstone balanced so much and the main problem is card expensive as hell"
"Ultra-mega short review of the game: It is both a card game and an online competitive game. This may be all that needs to be said about it, because the pros and cons of this game are typical of those kinds of games...The pros: Like you would expect from a good card game: the deckbuilding is nice, experimenting wacky stuff is fun, there is a lot to learn, collecting cards is a joy(its both cool to watch your collection grow and it feels good when you have it completed), the art on some cards is quite gorgeous, winning over an opponent that packs a deck full of gold/legs with a deck of almost only bronze and silvers is a magical awesome moment, other awesome moments: you pull a comeback, win with a very clever play(rare moments, but the rarity is what makes them so good)Like most online games: The game keeps evolving, you will always have oponents to play against with all levels of skill, if you take the ranking seriously, you will always have something to fight for, another higher objective to reach or fight to keep at the top if you are in grandmasters, the comunity is quite active and new interesting ideas pops quite often, and beating oponents using top tier decks using niche decks feels awesome(super awesome if you build the deck yourself from scratch)The cons: Happens in all cards games(that i play-magic, yugioh and hearthstone anyway...): Powercreep in the newer sets of cards that render old sets useless, busted staples cards that are almost not optional for a particular type of deck, win condictions cards that forces specific cards into your deck just to counter their game-ending effects, bad luck in the draw can be frustrating(especially if happens across multiple matches is a row)Online games always fuffer from: When the meta stabilizes, it is in a state where the is a large gap between ""B"" and ""S"" tiers decks, the ""S"" and ""A"" tier variety is usually very thin and deviating from that often results in frustrating losing streaks. Toxic players, after ""A"" rank, you always expect the salty ragequit that leaves you with a loading screen, muting oponents emotes is a must, foruns always have the obligatory oblivious jerk on every topicSpecific about this game: It is, for good or bad, very anime-esque: Manga style of art, overcrowded with females with oversized breasts, some historical characters turned females for some reason, have its share of cat-women... If that kind of thing triggers you, dont even bother...Comparing to other cards games, this one heavily favors the attacker: if its not your turn, you are in spectator mode, there is no way to interfere in the oponent's turn AND the agressor gets to choose how the battles will occur. The only defense mechanic is ward, basic skill that forces the oponent to remove that creature before he can deal direct damage. There is no traps to be afraid of and the turn dont have a specific battle phase, so the agressor can, for example, summon or play spells between attacks.There is also no deck or hand destruction, you only have to worry about losing a card if you put it in the field. This combos with the lack of defenses to favor a very snipey meta. The vast majority of people will either play agro or go for some OTK, and often you will see it coming but still lose because the options to protect yourself are so lackluster.AS a final comparison to other card games: it is inferior to the physical games, but it is much cheaper than magic and yugioh just cant make a decent game(there is a large number of games out there, the sayng goes that when u have many things to fill the same role is because they all suck). I also consider this game much better than hearthstone, they share many problems and hearthstone also suffers from things like overly random cards(really the amount of rng there is getting out of control)The general opinion is that game is golden in unranked, against a friend, in take 2 or until your rank is high to the point where you will be put against nothing but ""S"" and ""A"" tier decks. Well, i have to agree. Do i recommend it? I wish steam allowed me to make a neutral review, but i have to say yes or no, so i gess its Yes, it is a good game, if you like both card and online games this game features some of the best of both, just know that it also packs the worst of both."
"I started a steam account just for shadowverse, since I don't have an android phone or an apple device that can run shadowverse. Reason's for my positive review:1. The bonus packs given for starters are really helpful.2. The game balance is evident in the later stages of the game, when battling another player with your own deck.3. Luck of the draw has minimal effect on a polished deck.4. Art is really great.5. Original japanese voice. Even if the translated text is liberal and is made to fit a western type of conversation, it isn't a problem for me since I can understand japanese. 6. The tension I feel when opening a card pack.7. I enjoy it.Thank you Cygames!"
"Summary:> Pay for packs in order to actually be able to start grinding,> Not for casual players,> Deck styles are not as good as Hearth Stone.Long Story:I tried the game out as I was a fan of RoB. Was really happy about the free pack just for starting, but I quickly realized that without them the game is unplayable from the start. This a pay to win game. You need packs as it is unfeasable to grind out more packs or rewards as everyone else that has started playing the game before you will just destroy you every single match due to the fact they already have half a decent deck built. Also, the game mechanics is really a rip of Blizzards HS. Better artwork, but thats about it.  "
"A must play for any CCG fans.+Expanding Storyline that does not require in-app purchases.+Fairly easy to expand your card pool, even as a free-to-play. Of course like all games, you can't really get everything unless you spend a huge amount of time or whale (and it is best not to get everything anyway), but it is not difficult to assemble a deck that can compete with other people.+Beautiful Artwork from both original and other Cygames titles. Some cards are censored compared to the Japanese version, but it is not too much of a big deal.+No limits ranking system from beginner to AA3 (the point before Master), which then you go on a monthly ranking contest. You have all the time in the world to get to Master.-When RNG trolls you, you will feel like all the odds are against you. And sometimes the deck just hands you the win. Of course, that is the truth of CCGs.-Don't binge play this game. Take ample breaks between sessions as Shadowverse is one of those games where you burn out really quickly."
"The cards are too broken. All this does is make the game frustrating and difficult. Yes, the art is nice and the concept is cool, but the cards and class abilities are broken and ruins the entire game.If anyone has played hearthstone, imagine THESE cards being in hearthstone.(2 mana) after 1 turn, destroy a random minion. (FOR 2 MANA... Also, nothing can be done to prevent this card. And if there is a way to prevent it, its limited to 1 class).You thought murloc decks were annoying? Try fairy decks. This game has an evoloution system, so these 1,1 fairys turn into 3,3s with ease.Play at your own risk. If you get frustrated, it's normal, but i cannot recommend this game."
"Let get this off right now,do i like this game? yes i love this game but do i recommend it? NO absolutely NO its a cool game,nice art,good mechanic and such but the things that killed this game is the players,on other servers like Japan and such they use great deck that they come up with to win to outplayed their opponents but here  everybody use the same deck they dont care about anything they just want to win so you'll face the same deck over and over and over again and guess what? even when you want to have a normal friendly unrank match people play normal matches still use the same♥♥♥♥♥♥that are using in ranked.................take the advice from someone who has over 300h in this game JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS YOU'LL DO YOURSELF A FAVOR"
"Much better then hearthstone. This game just ♥♥♥♥♥ on hearthstone gameplay wise and f2p wise. You can build yourself a competitive deck in just a couple of days by beating the AI, completing missions and the story to earn rupies for packs & you also get around 40 FREE ♥♥♥♥ING PACKS JUST FOR BEATING THE TUTORIAL!!!!!! (Thats like $80 worth of free packs). Anyways, my favorite f2p game on steam as of now."
"It's a bit more complex than Hearthstone, doesn't have that much RNG, and gives you lots of free stuff to help you start playing. The only thing that HS have ""better"" than Shadowverse is the famous IP (warcraft lore). Also, you can play both on Steam and smartphone with the same account!"
"Was slightly irritated with having to download in game on crappy servers that timeout, Then annoyed that I couldn't change graphics during the tutorial, then got frustrated and uninstalled after being hit with another larger download that wasn't included with the first!"
The game is pretty good.  Art is good but a little 2 dimentional.  Plays similar to HS.  The major flaw of the game is that it doesn't have a full screen mode?!?!  Alright I've changed my review to thumbs up.  The fullscreen option is only available once you complete the forced tutorial.  The game is slick and polished.
9/10 better than Hearthstone I love this game its so much more F2P than It's cousin Hearthstone (Made by Blizzard)The mechanics are easy to get used to and if you aren't a huge fan of anime you should still get used to it pretty quickly.Overall good game definetly check it out if you like card games.
"15 hours in and I gotta say, I haven't enjoyed a CCG so much in years. The Story mode has me engaged enough to want to try every class, and the 4 that I have played so far have all left me with a satisfied sense of mechanics. There's enough content and different play styles, as well as practice, story, ranked, unranked, and the interesting Take Two matches, to keep my interest through whatever mood strikes.Awesome game, and for the price of FREE, there's no reason not to give it a shot."
"I think this game is much better than HS, easier to get cards, better client (faster, responsible). Not just recycled another game (like HS did with WoW). Current meta based on DBNE seems prty good, i like it. Cant tell for previous ones, didnt played at that time. Overall this is one very solid CCG. So far no regret for money invested to it, can't say same about HS....Main characteristics about game:- anime style (good quality, rly nice waifus)- its faster (usually games end pre turn 10)- evo mechanic for tempo plays - u can have 3  copies of legendary, which makes decks more consistent, not like in HS, when playing secret mage and praying to get aluneth to play it on 6turn... (on first sight it seem it makes it more expensive as in HS but trust me, its not the case)- prebuilt decks (good for noobs, i started with it, totally worth, especailly when u have no clue about game)- classes are different in way that you can actually feel it, u r not just playing different cards- lot of free stuff, much much generous comapred to HS, especially for new player! To start as new player in HS u need 400+ euro, no joke, thats fkin reality! So far it looks like u need to spent about half in Shadowverse as new player to build even some most of expensive decks, like summit haven for example.- ladder makes sense, u r not losing points when new season begins (why would you? your skill dont drop over night, right?), also it uses sort of 'elo' systems, not 'star' system, which i personally hated in HS- during match u have access to battle log of whole game!, u can see graveyard,u can watch replays of matches (only last 10 plaed)I may a bit sound as HS hater, but trust me, HS and blizzard did that all alone.... and thx to this i found Shadowverse, so thank you blizzard :)For me this is go for CCG. I recommend it."
"Well this game is much better than the other card game ""cough"" Hea ""ahem"" sto ""cough it has mechanics explained when you play the game and player that goes second have an equal chance to flipover the game with their""Evolve"" mechanic.Not to mention their artwork of the game.However if you are comparing with, Ma ""cough"" Gathe ""ahem"" and Gwe ""cough"" however those are some powerhouses in the TCG so Cygames have to up their enty in order to be better than them."
"It is a mobile game ported to PC. Thus it retains problems that plague mobile games.Paywall, Balancing Issues, Whaling, etc. All things expected.Cygames should probably stick to mobile games and Granblue. Leave the other platforms to competent developers."
"Following the massive success of Blizzard’s Hearthstone and the games that followed, Shadowverse is Cygames’ attempt to enter the CCG market. The game just recently hit Steam, but had already received some attention previously when it was mobile only. So just how good is Shadowverse and does it compare to the other games in the market right now?GameplayShadowverse has seven unique classes, called “crafts”. Each craft has their own hero and special ability which exist in many of their class cards. This makes the playstyle of every craft unique, and ensures that no two craft share the same roles. Shadowverse borrows some mechanics from Hearthstone, such as “mana”, and basic spell casting and minion combat remains the same. However, the key element in which Shadowverse differs is the evolution mechanic. The ability to give a minion increased stats and the ability to attack another enemy minion solves problems that plagues Hearthstone such as mid/late game minions being too slow to affect the board. This key factor sets Shadowverse apart from any other modern CCG. Another fact which Shadowverse pride’s itself on is its significant lack of RNG cards. That’s not to say they don’t exist, but they are far and few and rarely ever decide the game. Card collecting is largely unoriginal: liquefy cards for vials, use vials to create new cards, and opening a pack gives you eight cards. Shadowverse also has an alternate game mode, “take two”, which allows you to spend gold to draft a deck of cards two at a time, and battling with other players five times with similarly built decks for prizes. UI and SoundThe Shadowverse UI is directly ported from the mobile version with no changes, meaning it sometimes feels clunky with how large some buttons are, among other things. The game does support both languages, but the English voice acting sounds quite dull and cheap compared to the original Japanese voices.ArtThis game having a very anime based art style to attract Japanese audiences should come as no surprise. When it comes to the West though, the art work reception is either “love it” or “hate it”, as those who are unfamiliar with Japanese media may be turned away by some of the art in this game.MonetizationCygames, like most Japanese companies, are extremely generous when it comes to free gifts. The latest Darkness Evolved expansion came with ten free expansion packs, and players were also given packs to celebrate a download milestone just recently. In game cosmetics aren’t credit card only, and can be obtained via ranked play or just regular shop purchases. That said, purchasing the premium currency is quite expensive as the pricing was set more for heavy whales as opposed to casual spenders.Overall, I’d say that Shadowverse has a decent chance of being listed in the top online CCG’s very soon. Its generosity to the new players is unrivaled in the western markets, and its strategic mechanics and lack of random elements will attract long time players of this genre. The only major bump in the road I can foresee for Shadowverse is that its artwork may be enough to turn off many prospective players. That being said, I have faith that Cygames is capable of turning Shadowverse into a game capable of challenging the tyrants who’ve ruled over this genre."
"Truth be told, I play this game only for the nostalgic Rage of Bahamut recycled card art. This game is the child of Rage of Bahamut/Granblue Fantasy and Hearthstone except Rage of Bahamut (English version) passed away. That is the best way I can describe it. Being a RoB player, I don't fully accept this child into the family. Yeah, I'm just butthurt about the shutdown of RoB the English version, and I have every reason to be butthurt about it. But I'm not going to take it out on the child. RoB is still very successful in Japan and was the spearhead of mobile TCG outside of Japan with its own anime so the best I can do for RoB is to spread the joy of it. Never played Heathstone so I could care less about it. I'm the angry father that is still in disbelief that RoB was married off to Hearthstone.NOTE: I still recommend this game because its fine and all, I just have personal gripes about it. Its like Battlefield Hardline, it may have Battlefield in the name but its not a Battlefield game in my eyes (pretty sure anyone can agree, if it didn't have BF in the title, it would've been just fine). To whoever said ""There is an anime that is similar to SV called Rage of Bahamut Genesis with all the same characters"", I don't know who you are, but I will find you, and I will kill smack some sense into you."
"Heres my 2 cents as an avid online card player. Shadowverse IS a well made game. First off it is a card game. Nothing I hate more than downloading a game with cards in it to find out it is a phone app energy game lol. It comes complete with a campaign, ranked, and tournament game modes. The card graphics are unique and well made while the card animations are quite smooth. In the beginning playing this game feels like a real treat and you absolutely will not regret it. There are tons of free packs and gems thrown at you like candy. You'll be getting legendaries and epics all over the place and making tons of variations to decks.The only real issue I have and still have with this game is the extremely confined class cards. I would say about 90% of the cards are restricted to a single class and 10% are not. To top it off nearly all the classes have superior cards of the same type compared to basic cards which leaves you no reason to use them anyways except for one legendary neutral card that replenishes your evolve orbs. Not to mention it is super easy to get a bunch of rare cards in one or two classes then a legendary in a class that you have no cards for lol. I think something to fix this issue would be to allow someone to pick a pack for a certain class.Overall I really enjoyed my time in this game and had some epic comebacks and losses. Also some arena decks that were so synergized I didn't lose once. It gave a lot of good feels and do not regret but I do feel the lack of customization really effects the overall replayability."
"Shadowverse is very popular, especially in Asia. It's said to be some kind of successor of Rage of Bahamut, which adds some more popularity to it.The game is very simple to play, and each class has some mechanic that interact with its cards, making them stronger or adding extra effects.As some others have said, the game focuses a lot on heavy face damage. It may seem a bad thing considering that other games (MtG to be more specific) have more deck options, but I guess that's the design the developers chose - make a game where you have to play aggressive.The game gives players daily rewards, which are mostly gold and sometimes a free pack. The missions don't change each day, so you can play at your own pace. The downside is that some missions can be troublesome if you have to win with a class you don't have a good deck for (or wait until you can reroll it).The prices are not bad imo. Each pack costs $2, but you have a daily discount for the first one you buy - in this case, you pay $1. Buying cards with gold is no problem if you can complete your quests. Worst case scenario, you log in each day and save enough to buy them.All in all, it's a game worth a shot. It plays differently from other card games, with a heavy focus on aggressive strategies."
"The game is not p2w, just grind for missions and save gold for packs and hope for the best.- The game is more based on skill than on luck (but draws still matter)- you get higher chances of getting legendaries on the packs (1.5% every 1 card)- crafting complete decks are not hardyou definitely do not need to spend $250 like me to build decks, im a whale..Overall the game is interactive, entertaining and I LOVE the devs so generous!! AND LUNA IS BAE "
its pretty p2w really now unless you want to make a new account every new xpac because it so expensive to get a good deck and they seems they want a new xpac every 6 months. cant support this
"As someone who's easily bored by most puzzle/strategy games, I'm really liking Shadowverse and can see myself playing lots more of it in the future. Not only is there a full campaign/story mode (you aren't just fighting random mobs for no reason), there's technically seven story modes--Shadowverse features seven different playable characters, and you progress through each of their storylines. Every time you beat a chapter in one character's story, you have the choice to keep playing as that character or to switch to another. Each character also has a unique trait and the cards in their deck revolve around that trait. For example, one character, Luna, specializes in necromancy. Her deck is full of zombies and ghosts which, although weak in and of themselves, grant her necromancy points. As the number of points increases, her cards are gradually strengthened. Most of the time you're not dueling against mobs, but other playable characters. This encourages you to fully understand the strengths of each character's deck, as well as how to best exploit that character's weakness when playing as any other character. This is what really makes the game so interesting to me; it's not that hard to master one specific character's deck, but to master every deck? AND to be able to beat any one deck with any other deck? Every character's campaign is divided into chapters, and there's one duel per chapter. This keeps it short and sweet, and gives you the option to stop playing whenever you want. Makes this a perfect game for picking it up for 10-30 minutes at a time.The overlying plot is pretty cliche: end of the world, each character has their own agenda, converging storylines, etc. But the characters themselves aren't overly annoying, and neither is the voice acting (did I mention this game has full English VA?). Some characters are more interesting than others, and they're all pretty one-dimensional, but character development is not the focus of a TCG. The characters don't make me not want to play this game, and that's enough for me.This game probably won't appeal to hardcore TCGers, as they may find it overly simplistic. However, for someone like me who's primarily looking for simple, easy to learn, quick, and pleasant gameplay, this game is perfect. Thumbs up."
"Recipe for Shadowverse successServes 1 1 cup of Hearthstone 2 tablespoons of easily accessible ports 1 cup of No RNG 41 cups of free card packs 20 pounds of 2D TIDDIESProcedure1.   First, take the cup of hearthstone and mix it in a bowl with the 20 pounds of 2D TIDDIES2.   Next, stir in the 1 cup of No RNG and 41 free card packs3.   Mix and stir all together and pour into a pan made of waifus4.   Bake at 350° using the heat from Blizzdrone rage for 6 months5.   Remove from rage heat and let cool in the lower end of marketing to avoid Nu-male articles online complaining about how much 2D tiddies were present in the recipe whilst ignoring the entire fantasy creatures ingredients from the cup of hearthstone.5.   Finally, don't blunder your decorations put on after it has cooled, place them on in a timely manner before the heat sets in.Closing words: If you are a chef who enjoys making good looking food with a nice presentation. Then look no further! The ease of access for this amazing dish despite it's psuedo low cost ingredient count is sure to impress long-time chefs from all around. It varies in many ways to the Hearthstone dish counterpart it is compared to, but the taste is quite different and many chefs may argue that tasters only like it for the 2D TIDDIES that is present in the dish. However, while there is a large amount of 2D tiddies present, the dish has an even larger amount of more serious ingredients that many chefs from the opposite spectrum may come to find appealing. It is a great dish to try when you want something different from the dish that is seen on many household mentions. Don't think you're being a hipster for eating something different from the norm. You have taste that is more thought out then these other chefs that just say the first dish that their friends make is good despite going sour later on. It's a wide world just eat what you want."
"NOT recommend for variety and balances.Variety? nope, only 1-2 playable type (unless you're memes player, the best kind). This IS SHADOWverse, not a FORESTverse, DRAGONverse, PORTALverse, BLOODverse, RUNEverse, SWORDverse, HAVENverse nor NEUTRALverse, best not to say BALANCEverse.Ugly human anime arts (girl especially. I'm biased, YMMV) but Good Dragon (non-girl human anime with 'dragon' features abomination) and Monster related arts, though, and best of all, it has Jabberwock The Nightmare Handsome Spawn ❤.Oh, and this is Japan game, so expect no community feedback.Read someone reviews else for more information."
"I thought I got bored of card games overall, but now I see I was just bored of HS. Almost every aspect of this game is just one step above. Numerous things that people asked Blizz to implement in HS (for years) are in SV instead. Neutral spells. Alternative win conditions (other than your opponent's health being 0). Arenas with friends. Autosquelch. Generous packs and starter kits. Free single-player content. A way to comeback from being behind (evolve).No ladder reset every month.Probably even more stuff I can't remember right now.Worth a try."
"i have played a bit of hearthstone and some other trading card games. this one is pretty nice actually, especially if you like the artstyle. you get like 50 free packs for completing the tutorial which is a really nice boost, especially if u like opening packs.the gameplay is very easy to get into if you are familiar with hearthstone, and if you're not; the tutorial is very informative.not really a hearthstone killer - per say, but its nice to have both."
"Takes time to build a strong deck, the game is played for its ranked rather than the storyline. Only meta decks are played. Sometimes the meta is diverse, sometimes its cancerous. Extremely generous devs, gives tons of packs. Expansions every 2 months, rotation is fun and keeps changing the meta, new cards comes with tons of new mechanics. Really enjoyable."
"I was reviewing my reviews and saw that my review was apparently lacking, so here's a changed one. It's a very good card game, even more so than Hearthstone. Plus, with the better art design, Hearthstone would have a run for its money because of the waifus. Mechanics-wise, it's not much different from Hearthstone or any other card game similar to it. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a good strategy card game, or any fan of good graphics. Developers are really generous, giving so many freebies to anyone starting or anyone still playing the game.It's just that, battles can be really idiotic. The player who gets to start second gets an edge over the player who gets to start first. Other than that, I have no issue.Keep it up Cygames"
"Very generous developer, often gives free packs. Extremely F2P friendly card game, even though the current meta is a little lackluster it is still a lot of fun. I highly reccomend the game to anyone."
"Gr8 game, This is Hearthstone, just better. Fantastic free 2 play model for those who don't like to spend a penny (including cosmetic puchases with in-game currency) Very little if any RNG elements with the obvious exception of card draws. No luck is going to boost you up the competitive ladder like in other CCG's ""cough-cough"" ""Yag-Saroon"" Great artwork (might not suite everyones taste but its still exceptionally well done) Incredibly well written, free and fun to play single player campaign for each class in the game along with rewards for completing those stories. (its basically HS adventures, but they are free and very story driven to fit into the lore of the entire game) All in all this is a fantastic game developed by people who clearly have a passion for and love what they are doing, intent on providing a free to play game to the community and a game that is skill based and RNG free. I have been everywhere, from Hearthstone to TES Legends and everything in-between, and I can honestly say I wouldn't recommend anything else. Shadowverse is a great CCG."
Shadowverse CWG (Collectible Waifu Game)A faster paced Hearthstone with more advanced mechanics and extremely good soundtrack7 free and long story missions with nice rewardsVery generous start i opened like over 100packs in first day without paying anythingAlternate Leaders can be bought for little gold36 deck slots for freeAmazing card art and responsesExtremely amazing legendary card entrancesNew expansion every 3 months which keeps the game freshBut no 144fps support :(
"I currently have 325 hours put into this (not including mobile). With confidence I can say Shadowverse is absolutely worth playing. It's in a league of its own when compared to it's closest rival, Hearthstone. Most of the negative reviews are people who are just spiteful aor do not fully understand the game.Pros:Very F2P friendly, you don't have to spend anything to make a few competitive decks. You get TONS of gold and free packs, while declining oly a little bit in income later. There is no paywall or super grinding after initial rewards.There is no one dominate play style. Unlike Hearthstone which caters to aggro, Shadowverse's meta is always changing and adapting due to players countering. There are very rarely any buffs or nerfs to card.Much less RNG than Hearthstone. There are very few cards that draw or do things randomly, and the cards that do, are still very particular in what they do so you can still control the outcomeSteam and Mobile versions can be linked so you can play on the goRanking rewards reset each month, however your actual rank doesnt.Cons:UI could use a rework but its functionalSome of the art is very suggestive which can be a problem if you're playing in publicSome of the voice acting is terrible, but rest are fineThe premium currency (Crystals) seem a bit expensive, but the game is already F2P friendly enough."
"be very carful putting real money into this, there are glitches the community seems willing to dismiss and the developers aswell when your money goes missing with ""no way to recover it""  Steam cannot help you either.  there are also glitches in card interactions that will lose you games, again the community seems to like to dismiss this.its a fun game, when it works, just be very carful when using real money, and remember fans will defend products to the bitter end regardless of its state."
"Great game in most aspects.Like a refined Hearthstone gameplay wise, lots of viable decks you can play.Lots of freebies for new players, so you can hit the ground running instead of grinding through basic decks before you can play a deck you actually want to play.Lots of content to playthrough, and very free-to-play friendly overall.Only bad thing about it really are: - No way to reconnect to a game if you completely DC.- The UI on PC is bad because it is a direct port from mobile.Otherwise, I hightly recommend it. Really addictive, and fun for both casual and hardcore card game players."
"Great game. Each of the classes have unique mechanics that make every one of them enjoyable. My potato laptop can't play Hearthstone, but it runs this game incredibly well. This is even with all the animations and maps turned on.The one gripe I have is that there is no incentive to rank up. There are point achievements, but monthly rewards are only given to Master ranked players, and the climb there is incredibly arduous. This promotes some players to farm low ranks and concede matches so they can get all the achievement points."
"Stay away from this game right now. It's terribly unbalanced, people running the same broken aggro decks all day long even in casual que. Cygames seems to be struggling finding their balance with new card creation and balancing legendaries, especially since they refuse to nerf many cards that are way too good(I'm looking at you time-worn Levi.)Hopefully Cygames can break their fall soon and get this game back on track with a stable meta like in the earlier days.I can't recommend this game in it's current state, my conscious couldn't take it. I'll change my review when things get better.今すぐこのゲームから離れてください。それはひどく不均衡で、人々はカジュアルキューでも同じ壊れたアグロデッキを一日中走っています。 Cygamesは、新しいカードの作成とバランスのとれた伝説とのバランスを見つけるのに苦労しているようです。特に、あまりにも多くのカードが好きではないことを拒否しているからです（私はLeviを忘れています）。うまくいけば、Cygamesは彼らの秋を間に合わせることができ、初期のように安定したメタでこのゲームを軌道に戻すことができます。私はそれが現在の状態でこのゲームをお勧めできません、私の意識はそれを取ることができませんでした。物事が良くなると、私のレビューを変更します。 "
"Very fun game with an even more so generous developer team that makes the game truly F2P. If you ever get tired of the P2W game that is Hearthstone but still want to play a good card game then don't look any further.(Oh and ignore the negative reviews. At least 50% of them if not more complain about one and only thing and that is the fact that game, having been made by a Japanese company, has a very Japanese vibe/art style. Sadly all these reviews hate on the game just because it is ""weeb Hearthstone""...)"
"Just a short review highly reccomending this game as a CCG.Note: my actual hours are not acurately reflected as I've spent a lot of time linked to the mobile versionWith that being said, shadowverse is fun. Balance wise, the devs make efforts to change both rotation and unlimited formats (Equivalance of Hearthstone's Standard and Wild). There's a kinda generic story mode to the game, but serves well in practicing against the A.I. With regards to the A.I. - they can kick your♥♥♥♥♥further into the story without a good deck. Play the first 5 chapters or so of every character and get a feel for each deck would be my reccomendation. The game gives x50 free card packs to new players, which is quite a hefty amount and allows you jump right into the game. Each character has their own sort of trait, which can then be used for different synergies. Kinda rambling here, but It's a fun CCG and I like the direction the devs are taking it. If you're weeb like me and are looking for a fun CCG, I'd definetly reccomend it. Very good contender to Hearthstone."
"*Anime waifus *Fun and simple mechanics*Decent Story*Good Artwork*Nice to the eye UI*Good CCG with a japanese art styleHas F2P elements but over other CCG's the f2p elements are not horrendus. So its acceptable to an extent, overall gameplay  complents decks and playstyles are easy to grasp once you spend enough time playing."
"Great artwork, amazing voice actors, and neat special effects. This game is very generous to newcomers as well as fair to its own staff from what I have heard about Cygames management."
"Pros:Great animationStory w/ voice actingCons:Repetitive and grindy to get the best cardslimited modesUpdate:Game has become more unbalanced, especially for returning players.. you only get 10 new packs from the latest expansion. might recommend to start new account for the packs. majority of the players you face have legendary cards. take two might be the only way to win games."
For people who hate to spend money on card games i would recommend this game it has a lot of unique classes and mequanics each for every class you can get hooked pretty easy and becouse you get a lot of packs early you can make a least 1 or 2 competitive decks while the meta isnt the best right now i can still find it enjoyable for me i still play it from time to time
"not worth your time,heavy unbalanced,broken mmr,not saying this game is made for asians...because almost olny asians play this game,tried it but got anxious and nervous ,8 hours of torture,I can see the thirst for money from devs.I don't reccomend this game,but try it for yourself,dunno maybe you'll like it."
"As someone who has played a lot of free2play CCGs, I can say that - in my humble opinion - Shadowverse is without a doubt the best and there is a reason why Blizzard copied it to the degree they had.You can play this game perfectly without spending money, as well, as a lot of the cards you start with aren't halfbad."
"I have seen a lot of reviews and thought of adding my own take on this game. It is a solid TCG. If you want to know more it is basically a more competativ take on heartstone. A lot more generous, while many seem to complain about the fast expasions they give a lot of free stuff to all Players.  harder to get into but also more generous for those who play regularly. Oh yeah and it is anime af.Pros:-fast gameplay-lots of combos-good number of freebies-Interesting arena concept(draw two)-all classes keept viable through a lot of expansions-3 quest that reset simultanious-huge starter rewards for playing vs ki-decent solo gameplay (campaign and ki matches)Cons:-BS finischers get killed in round 8or 9 -ridiculous fast aggro to counter that-perfecting a deck is as expensiv as in heartstone-no info to the boni for new players-Quests demand you to win -new players have to look into wiki etc to find actuall valid DecksVerdict:Decent but steep learning curve. Best freebies from all free TCG'S I tried. Try if you want but look at guides if you want to go mp."
This game : Turn 1 - you playing whateverTurn 2 - you playing whateverTurn 3 - you playing whateverTurn 4 - you playing whateverTurn 5 - you playing whateverTurn 6 - you playing whateverTurn 7 - you playing whateverTurn 8 - You playing SUPER SAIAN WEEBO WAIFU LOLICON ... and you win the game100% will play again
"I mean, I said it once and I'll say it again. Ding Dong.You like card games? This is a good card game. Try it out!And you get like 40 free packs off the start, so you'll have something good to start with.DING DONG."
"A well-balanced, well thought out card game system, with unique characters, leaders, and playstyles. 100% would recommend to anyone looking for a fun way to pass some time online or on mobile. It's a fantastic time-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."
"Pretty good game. It plays very similar to Hearthstone but with an anime feel to it. There are some elements that are different. Such as having 20 hp, the evolve system which allows for some comeback mechanics if used correctly, and the classes themselves having traits unique to them. I like the Runecraft one because it's combo-focused with the way spellboosts work. Each spell you cast does something special to spellboost cards. The more spell you play the better the benefits can end up being.The game also front loads you with tons of cards you can get in shop. It's like 30-40 boosters or something, each containing 8 cards. If you're lucky you can make at least one good deck to help you learn the game. The learning curve isn't that high though. If you've played Hearthstone, you'll catch understand the jist pretty swiftly. Most of the key words are the same just with different names.At any rate, it's free like Hearthstone so you'll have a good time."
"Good game, the card animations and art are decent, also if you plan to play in laptops or tables computer the game run smooth.recommended for people wo want to start card games and like anime  design."
"Quick games, you recieve a very good amoint of packs which can be liquified or the cards you need.Haven't ran into anything that costs a lot to get a good deck so far at most I need to buy the legendaries which is around 10k vials"
"At some point you just realize getting grandmaster in shadowverse is all about who spams the latest cancer tier 1 deck for the most hours. This repeats every single expansion, 1-2 deck archetypes ridiculously outclassing all other ones, and these meta decks is all you see in ranked, and unfortunately in the rest of the game modes as well. So unless sheeping the same tier 1 deck every expansion and thinking you're a leet gamer exploiting KMR's life-threateningly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance team who doesn't learn after 10 expansions is your idea of fun, then i wouldn't bother playing. Also enjoy low-price core cards getting reprinted in higher rarities making the game less free-to-play expansion by expansion, which funnily enough used to be a big premise of this game. Ranked actually is just 2 people with the same deck against eachother and game gets decided on a coinflip of who goes first. There's no variety outside of ranked either since surprise surprise people like winning, so you bet they'll play tier 1 in other modes as well. Just don't bother, you'll end up regretting falling for the meme."
I can't even finish installing it. It keeps saying the connection timed out while installing even though I got done playing Overwatch and have had 0 problems with the connection. Great game. Obviously deserves a mighty thumbs up.

"Can you do everything your opponents can do: Apparently not.- By level 10 of a certain bloody character's story, the enemy could use a deck with whatever cards they wanted in it, you are limited to your Bloodcraft cards and Neutral. One of the staff for their booth at DHM said try Unimited mode, but that wouldn't let me put in other cards either. Oh well.Pros:Got free swag from them at Dreamhack MontrealWould recommend if you like simpler CCG games."
"Cards are ridiculously imbalance at their first release. Got better with time. A lot of RNG involved in many things but luckily not so much in the battle. Graphic is pretty but inconsistent. Music is good but has too few of them lol. Overall a good game, but can be frustrated to play sometimes."
"For those who relish in turn based strategy games, fantasy warfare and card battles?..well this is something for you. Although it requires some intelligence and patience it also offers a range of exciting classes and card deck strategies you can implement to suit your playing style. It's certainly not a pay to win cash grab in fact it offers a huge first time promo for new players which gives you a tonne of card packs to get you started which if used properly could see you having a close to perfect deck out of the gate if you know what you're doing. It's also quite a competitive game with an outstanding rank system, rewards, missions, single player and story mode.For me the game is a breath of fresh air and I was so happy to find it being free to play with no real restrictions blocking us from enjoying the game to it's full extent. I believe this game was released as a free to play for players to enjoy it and to support the next phase in the game that will be released soon and I will be a whole hearted supporter after I've sank my teeth into this game. But be warned, it's extremely addictive and could have you hooked.The only negatives I would say is that the game is not complete yet however there's more to come and the game is still new. It needs more classes and leaders and customizations but aside from that I can't fault it. 8/10."
Great card game. Quite balanced and really interesting mechanics. Love the generosity of the developers. Also very accessible as you can play it on mobiles and tablet as well. 10/10
this game is f2p (its not p2w) when u launch the game u get 40 free packs and u can get alot of cards u craft the cards to get better cards the game is fun i like everything about it the gameplay is fast that i dont need to think about time and the best thing that there is alot of different cards from every hero and( less natural cards )the friend system is bad that u cant see ur friend losing in arena :ci give it 9/10
"There are a lot of former Hearthstone players jumping ship to this game, and I can see why. To be fair, it is probably at least partially due to the game being new and therefore inherently more exciting to explore, however I would still recommend Shadoverse as the superior alternative. If you have not played HS before and have no idea what I am talking about, then disregard everything I said up to this point.Short Version: Pros- interesting mechanics and card synergy- wide variety of strategies and playstyles- easy to pick up, both in terms of gameplay and getting cards for freeCons- personally not a fan of the flashy anime art (some could see this as a pro)- like any card game, potential balancing issues can lead to salt (not too bad atm)Long Version:Shadoverse has great emphasis on synergy, as opposed to stand alone powerful cards that are considered 'safe' in any situation. Each hero/class has an inherent ability or theme associated with it that is complimented by cards that also follow a similar theme. For example, the Bloodcraft class has the Vengeance ability that activates added effects in your cards when you are at 10 hp or lower. There are also certain subthemes in each class that allow for even more strategies and win conditions to be developed.One thing that can be difficult to get used to is the evolution mechanic. Each player starts with either two or three evolution points (first player gets 2 second gets 3) that can be spent in order to power up your followers. This almost always results in an instant stat gain and the ability to immediately attack any non-hero enemy, and sometimes enables an added special ability depending on who or what is being evolved. This allows for some interesting comeback plays, but also makes a certain game mode called 'Take Two' favor whoever has the most evolution points (so there are some potential balancing issues associated with evolution). If you are worried about this game being freemium, then don't worry. The Shadoverse team is generous in giving cards out, enabling free to play scum (like me) to still be competitive. Anything that can be bought with real money can also be bought with in game currency (which is easily obtainable), including hero portrait reskins.As far as art style goes, some may be initially turned off by the excessive levels of anime. For me the gameplay was more important so I got over it, but if you absolutely cannot stand that type of art style then you will have to stick to playing Urias (vampire Geralt) or save up for the Runecraft reskin Erasmus (Gandalf) and enable the ""standard background"" in multiplayer to relieve visual clutter."
"At first i was very sceptical of this game, since it is a Digital Card Game and we all know how those turn out..I thought i wouldn't want to invest into another one since I already play Hearthstone and have all the cards there, but i still tried it out since i saw a lot of people talking about it and urging others to at least try it.And i must say i am SO GLAD that i tried it out, because i immediatly fell in love with it!This is literally the only non-pay-to-win Card game out there, you can literally play this game as a F2P game without investing any money into it, but seeing how well made and polished it is, you will want to support it.Firstly the developers are VERY generous with the free packs they give you ( I got around 40+ when i first started ) and one pack includes 8 cards. There are daily login bonuses and 3 daily missions, loads of achievement bonuses, level up bonuses etc, you can easily get the cards by just playing the game.Secondly the game ACTUALLY has a Main Story which you can play with each of the characters ( of which there are 7 ), as you play the story mode you unlock yet more cards and Arena passes for free.The game is very complicated, but the tutorial system with the Story mode does a great job of teaching you how each of the classes play, you should definetly play through the story mode before heading into arena or ranked play. ( The story mode is around 8 - 10 hours long, its pretty insane, also its fully voice acted ).So to sum it up, you should absolutely play this game, even if you play HS or MTG, at least try it, i did and now i don't even care about HS."
"I've waited so many years to play a card game like Yu-Gi-Oh but I don't wanna get down because of the confusing rules. Shadowverse come like an answer beside the rules that easy to understand, they have great storyline (anime based), astonish card artwork, voice actor and the cool graphic. Please add more story mode. This game surely need more story for new leaders."
"10/10 would Daria againAside from memes the game is as following-Really generous. gives out a ton of packs so making a viable deck is easy enough-Has a decent story. gives out more free stuff as you complete it (Vials,Sleaves etc)-more on strategy then RNG -Has a evolution mechanic which can turn the tides of every game (Ceridwen+Balor or khawy is ♥♥♥♥ing gold on my rank)-Did i mention it's really generous-Anime style. if you're a weeab like me you will enjoy this stylebasically hearthstone Waifu edition with less RNG and giving out packs like it's christmas"
"I know I haven't played long, but I just wanted to say that this card game is fairly solid. It's basically HearthStone but with a few added machanics as well as Cygames repurposed Rage of Bahamut cards. Glad to see them reusing their art since Rage was taken down.Like many have said, if you like Blizzards HearthStone but want diffrent art then you should try this game out.P.S. I was actually ready to hate the game thinking they ripped the art from Rage but then realized it was made by the same company so I decided to be fair and try it out, to my surprise it wasn't that bad."
"I fell in love with this game immediately, it's very fun! It has nice graphic, and fun story.But everything change when I face Elana, PtP, Dimension shift...And realized that 90% of the time I have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ I'm talking about.Just play it, it's free!"
"game is nicegraphics is nice""Dont play this game if you dont like insta win cards""Meaning deck makeing and logical thinking is not usable, you only need to play one card ""enstatuated seraphim"" and you win. or you will play against instant win deck!Its realy brain killer for all profesinal card players, 0 fun with insta win braindead cards.rare cards destroy game!like card enstatuated seraph (insta win card - text of card is ""you won game""there is no defense against this.Full game is totaly made for braindead monkeys. Beter you unistall this nonsence insta win cards!Until this card is removed from the game or changed, this full game is unplayable noncompetative and full of crap insta win cards with text that you insta win gamethis card is also extreme rare, you would think they could at least made it common card so ppl dont have to buy it, its totaly wining card, no logical defense against it. make this card common, than  run statistics on win chances.This games development is totaly retardet. makeing insta win cards!Dont bother its good to lose time, but insta win cards make this game total crap.good i did not put a single cent on this game, i would regret playing a card game with insta win cards!"
"the metas are so one dimensional and uninsteresting, with severe powercreeping throughout the years, Cygames turned one of the most promising CCG to one of the most frustrating experience in gaming."
"Pros:- Good art- Very generous with in game currency and packs- Different drafting experience: take two cards from two sets of two cards instead of pick oneCons:- Story mode is skippable, story is complete garbage- 100% of the meta is the same type of deck: neutral- 100% of the meta is non interactive: basically play neutral and go face- non existent balancing- Poor non interactive card design"
"Bad- Matches end too soon (not much creativity)Good- Great for free-to-play (much better than Hearthstone)- Can buy cheap preconstructed decks- There are in-game online tournaments- There's esport scene- Can permanently disable emotesYou may wonder why ""Matches end too soon"" is a deal breaker, here's why:1) It's originally a cellphone game, it's made so you play more matches in less time than actual games.2) The damage ceiling is too high (if any). Things hit like trucks.3) Recently there are effects that continue for the rest of the match even after the cards are gone. You can deal free damage each turn."
"Good things:+ It has good anime art.+ It isn't pay to win, you start the game with alll the clases unlocked with their own basic decks that are not bad at all. Also you start the game with 40 card packs (each pack has 10 cards) and you can reroll account.+ The game is fun.+ The game have some unique gameplay features like envolving cards+ The classes are very different and unique, and the gameplay feels totally different depending of the class since they have exclusive mechanics and strategies.Bad things:- Some balance problems like havencraft with their Elana card.- The menu is somewhat clunky and it has long load times whenever you enter a sub-menu even if you are playing on PC. Grade: 9/10"
"For me who never played a Game like this it was a good begining. I like the Anime style of it and the Story is very intersting aswell. It is cool, that you can choose different classes from wich everyone has a different story. I hope it will be continiued. "
"I wasn't into TCG before, but this game got me really interested. It's not like other TCG games where just 1 deck could mean instant domination, it has variety, you can choose between different classes which has its own strengths and weakness. There is also a variety of ways to play each class, so that each game is actually different than having to face the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing deck every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. Also the characters are really good, even the characters in some cards are adorable af."
"This is a fun Magic-lite game with absolutely stellar graphics. I can't say much about the meta (I'm severe noob at deck building), but there's plenty of solo content, the mechanics are fun, and I don't feel a lot of play-to-win pressure.EDIT: Full disclosure, I stopped playing this game after a few months because I couldn't adapt to the new metagame environment caused by the next expansion. This is likely a personal issue, due to never having played competitive CCGs before, but Shadowverse stopped being fun really quickly, which was disappointing. I'd still recommend it if you're into Magic."
"This game is the first CCG I fall in love with (since the old Yu-Gi-Oh).It first seems pretty equal to Hartstone but it has so much new mechanics like evolving!It is totally fun to play and I recommend it to everyone who wants to try a new sort of CCG's.Also, the Japanese voices are pretty cool :)"
"MUCH BETTER THAN HEARTHSTONE!!!Deeper than most of the other digital collectable card games, but of course, not as deep as Magic The Gathering.In my opinion, it's a good CCG for people tired of the bullcrap Hearthstone pulls every expansion. Plus, the devs actually know what they are doing in terms of balance, RNG (very little), and much more generous free-to-play business model."
I can't even update. the game is stuck at 1.5%(slow internet btw) and because of that the game eats up my CPU  and my CPU temps reaching 80-85C. The additional download must be there on purpose to be used as benchmark for CPUs. 27mb space for benchmarking APP GREAT
"At least try it. Its pretty fun. I haven't gotten to the level most people have, but from what I've played it seems balanced. Side note: drop rates for the rarest cards are 1.25% better than HS."
"For a mobile platform, Shadowverse is NOT a bad game though we won't go as far as saying it's the best CCG. Shadowverse has a variety of cards to collect including ""holos/foils"" and best of all, they have made it rather easy gathering special deck cards from packs. No spending money, maybe a little grinding, and multiple choices to choose from. With great graphics to compliment their game they also offer unique mechanics that is not often (if at all) seen in other CCG games. They have hassle free evolving, unlike other CCG where you continuously have to grind just to evolve a specific card. Not here! That's a load off my shoulder because me and grinding don't get along unless it's in the bedroom.  On top of that, if you find yourself stuck on the story, you can use a special pre-built deck to help you with that story chapter. Though you don't get to keep it. However, there are some things that may turn a handful of players away. It's repetative! No matter which Leader you choose for your deck, you are guaranteed to do the same thing. They stories are hardly different as each character is connected with one another in some pathetic way. No spoilers, but one of them enjoys killing people which is each Leader you come across until later in the story. All n' all, it's not a bad game especially when it comes from a mobile platform. It's to be expected from CCGs to be repetative, so if you don't mind that you should not have an issue playing this game.+ Good Graphics+ Better Mechanics from the Average+ Plenty of Cards to Collect - Repetative - Not the BEST Story Line- Needs Very Minor Fixes+/- It's basically a game to just pass the time which there is nothing wrong with. Don't expect a grand adventure."
People who are downloading the game and are having troubles.If you get a black screen then downscale your resolution for your PCfor an example mine (1920 x 1080(default) to 1366 x 768(new resolution) back to 1920 x 1080 (go back to default))
"Pros: It's ""free""Somewhat derivitive, but fast paced tcg with simple mechanicsIt can be fun to play when you have a synergistic deck goingTake two mode is a pretty fun draft format with good rewardsGood animated art and (japanese) voice actingUpsets feel good, really really goodThe titles (flares) are a nice perkIn-match emotes are funCons:I've never been saltier in my lifeExtremely limited tactical optionsNo real deck templates to edit into beginner or archetypal decksMost matches are very one sided, for or against youIn-match emotes are very limitedRNG DependantIt's free, so you might as well try it out if you like TcG's and you have the time."
"It's a board-centric game like Hearthstone, but without the mindless smashing cards together thanks to the evolve system. Does have a slight bias for whoever goes 2nd, but it's still good fun. I see a healthy mixture of aggro/midrange/control/combo on ladder, and a mixture of all 'crafts' or factions.Gives you like, 40 packs just for installing the damn thing. If you don't get good legendaries, just reroll your account on your phone or on an android emulater, then copy your account over with the link system."
"I honestly thought people were exaggerating, they were not. This is the ultimate virtual card game imo and I'll never play Hearthstone again. I refuse to play the mobile version as they require persmissions for everything on your phone. But this steam version is the bees-knees."
"Really great and fun ccg but...you can clearly tell it wasn't formatted for pc almost at all and was only brought over from mobile as a cash grab. That doesn't mean it isn't a good game, just wish the UI was different."
"Top-tier waifus left, right and center. A couple of really good cards aren't waifus but instead dragons or something but you can just play the waifu cards and lose instead, some of the heroes aren't waifus but you can buy packs to replace them with waifus (or packs to replace the default waifus with dudes, but c'mon who does that),"
"A wonderful ccg. I really enjoy this game. since the game came out on moblie ive been playing it non-stop. anyone who likes hearthstone,magic, yugioh, cardfight, etc or even someone who likes anime will prob enjoy this game!"
"More Balanced than HearthStone.JP-Game so expect freebies whenever there's an event/holiday/whatever and whenever there a problem on their(Cygames) side.Constant updates to Balance OP decks.Requires for you to invest time to ""GIT GUD"" and ""GIT MO CADS"".It has ""Dual-Audio"".Has Daily Missions and Daily Log-In Rewards. Has Story mode."
I hate this game.I hate the fact that im always 1 off lethal.I ♥♥♥♥ing hate Albert.I hate Aggro Blood.I hate dying to jorm nacht damage.I hate never getting the 1 alt leader i want from packs.I hate BnBI ♥♥♥♥ing hate prenerf Alice.I love this game. 10/10 would pull Aria alt from a promo pack again
This is a fun game that is very generous with how many cards it provides you at the start. The game is also pretty easy to get the hang of and deckbuilding is fun. I never invested any money into this game and have a good 24 hours of fun. Beyond that? I don't know! But I did have fun and maybe you will too.
"Very generous CCG. There are some parts of the meta I'm not very happy about but it's hard to complain when you can get at least 1 competitive deck per season for free. For those who don't like ladder, the game has a ton of free single player content."
"Amazing game but, please please make the PC version of the UI. i swear it drove so many people out of this game. the UI. it felt so extremely claustrophobic.i know this is a mobile port and a good one at that but making the ui 100% the same is a bad move in my opinion, i am new to the game, and it makes me feel like i need to do so much work compared to most CCG just to do basic stuff like deck building.you guys really need to make a PC UI. please for the love of god."
"Animated and Voice on almost all of the cards.I won't count imbalanceness in this game as a point to say no to this game.Most of the TCG will have this kind of problem anyway.(There are Meta deck in those game)The problem would be how hard it is to create a deck you want.Because it's so hard to create a rare card and even harder for higher rarity.And cards belong to its own faction (except Neutral which you can use in all deck)You can't use card in different faction to your leader.So it will take you really long time to create a deck for each leader.You need a lot of patience to play this game....Like ,really a lot."
"The best ccg i've ever played. Unique mechanics such as evolve, enhance (sometimes want to get rid this out), accelerate, etc. Healthy gameplays especially in rotation format. Less rng effect to stimulates our decision making and card managing."
"It's a good game. It takes a bit to be able to make a decent deck but Cygames is generous with free packs. Games are designed to be faster than in other CCG, like Hearthstone. Most decks have either an aggro win condition or play some op cards that wil end the game. Players only have 20 HP and it can go by pretty quickly. I recommend it however."
"One of the better CCGs I've played. Honestly it's no different than most of them, fairly generic, but the art style and warm feel of the menu and ui really help with creating a vibrant playing field. Not to mention I earned about 40 free card packs from various expansions just for downloading the game a while back."
If you want to play a card game it is probably the best one for a few reasons.- Nerfs/Buffs more frequently than Hearthstone- Diverse meta- Card packs cheaper & have more cards (8 per pack)- Very generous to f2p players- Sexy anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥s- Sexy anime girls- Sexy anime frogs 
"With seven different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? Itâ€™s entirely up to you."
"PROS:Best CCG right now, incredibly free to play no life drain game. More than +100 free packs for 1st login, Cygames (the devs) has a lot of money so they dont give a single F about giving you free "".jpg or virtual money"" gifts, so you can enjoy making your tier 1 or meme decks very easy with the first login. CONS:Its not a cons per se, but the game is heavily focused on the competitive environment, with weekly/monthly prized IRL tournaments and the hard ranked, you will find tier 1 decks even in beginner rank, due to the free stuff that you get when you start playing. So if you want to enjoy the game just for fun, play unranked, and dont cry when you face ranked, just git gud."
Anime waifus!!!Best CCG out there!-Devs are very generous with rewards and card packs etc so no pay 2 win here.-Playing legendary cards feels great because they are actually very powerful and fun to play with unlike hearthstone where legendary cards are boring and don't do that much most of the time.-Very small amount of RNG besides drawing cards.-Great art of most cards.-Card nerfs -Fun/helpful eventsI wish i never started playing Hearthstone and just went straight to Shadowverse so give this game a try!
"I have been in and out of this game ever since Darkness Evolved (the second set of cards in the game) and never have I had more fun smashing face in a TCG/CCG except for Infinity Wars, sadly the game died so me and my friends switched over to shadowverse and the developers have created a shelter for gamers like me who lost their home to find a new one in Shadowverse. I have always liked the game for everthing it has yes there are a ton of freebies and originally that turned me off but for returning players like me who come back after a few months it helps us keep up with the meta and ranked so thank you devs. Gameplay: 9.5/10Story: 6/10Playability (free to play): 8/10Microtransactions: Expensive/10Fun: 11/10Community: 9/10 (if you know where to look)Devs creation of community: 4/10 (They try to get the community together by hosting Grand Prix and events for private matches but ultimately fail to give a platform for players to meet each other)Graphics/Design: 11/10 (Every card looks absolutely stunning and captivating which is one reason I keep coming back)Now alot of people complain that they can't get the legendaries necessary for the meta and while I admit it seems like a daunting task. If you are a new player don't worry about getting the legendaries play through the story and find ways to build decks that are unique but can crush your friends the only reason to dip into the meta is if you are trying to go somewhere in ranked. As a new player I would say to play the story for a bit but maybe you get bored, if you have friends who also play try playing private matches against them. Then finally when you get the hang of the game try out the arena and Take Two which is basically a draft format where you are given a pool of cards and you will have to select two cards out of the choice of four that they give you until you have made a deck. Then it is time to play again. Over time you will eventually get into the meta naturally and you will have many many vials to create any legendary that you want but pulling them out of packs is fun too. So remember build up your vials for the decks you want and the legendaries then go into ranked and smash face! I hope you enjoyed reading this I know it was alot but I really do appreciate this game for what it offers and I hope you can too!"
"Hi, my name is Lena , i have problem there s took too long downloader from SEA ( Indonesia ) then always interrupted by unknown reason, can u fix it, for me i dont know whats problem cause i use 50 MBps connection then i ask my friend too he had same problem with me, i wanted to plauy tshi game so badThanks"
"From a purely casual point of view, I am really enjoying this.The art is beautiful, I appreciate the color palette and style.The music is both appropriate for the game's tone and graphics, and is also well orchestrated.The voice acting (at least for as far as I have progressed) is well done.  To me, the voices fit the characters, and convey emotion, without being over the top or too cliche.Gameplay is what you would expect out of a modern TCG.I don't write reviews often, if at all, but this took me by surprise.  Especially since I have seen it in the store before but never really bothered to took a look."
"Hi, I'm the guy that made 'that' guide. I'm writing this just to complete the november nomination reward thing.Game's cool. Only problem is that they do not allow switching to Jap voice with Eng words. Then again, the English dub actually changed a significant portion of the storyline for whatever reason... Oh and they censored Isabelle... But all in all, a great game!"
"As I expected, the current state of the game unplayable and is not enjoyable anymore. I don't understand why it was so necessary to print such a large amount of cards in a short period of time, instead of allocating more time for balancing certain cards (yes, they balancing a few cards that affect meta in a few months after expansion...and even with those 'right nerfs' i want to choke myself sometimes, still remember nerf of Piercing rune instead of Levi or Daria; nerf of Catacomb Prince instead of Eachtar. And know what? You will never see the nerfs of legendary cards like in old times i guess, what about current expansion...pray guys, maybe they will nerf Spawn of Abyss, but i don't think so, maybe they rework Baphomet..this is right but not that powercreep, first was aegis and now this one...I don't even want to talk about Grimnir...).With each expansion the game is getting worse, for some strange reason with the addition of new cards, the pool of playable decks is getting smaller, although it should be the vice versa, right?The golden time of 'Darkness Evolve' has passed and for some reason i remember it as real 'Wonderland Dream'. Those flashbacks with Fighter and Goliath cards...Seems like they trying to kill the game as i see. The people seems like lost their mind and doesn't care about fun in this game anymore. Even unranked is full of same cancer/net decks... This is not the 'testing place' as it was before in old time, truly sad.Wanted to post review in RoB expansion , where all the mess began, but closed my eyes on those mistakes made by developers one time, forgiven again in TotG, but not now, enough guys , this is cry of my soul already, i can't handle this anymore."
"It's honestly better than Magic.Pros: FunStrategic Interesting campaign for each character Hundreds of different cardsDecent amount of characters BeautifulCons:Try hards >.>Campaign can be a lil beotchBut, overall all, I give it 9.2/10Recommended"
"This game takes a lot of the problems with other collectible card games like Hearthstone and fixes them.  The 1st vs. 2nd discrepency?  Fixes it with the evolution mechanic.  Want crazy combo decks? Check.  Aggro ruining your day?  The minions are not statted as aggressively, and there are a lot of counters to aggro.  Want to play a large number of varied, power, but still fair decks?  Want lots of free content?  You can definitely build a top tier deck for free in this game.  I highly recommend it for any players who enjoy collectible card games."
"The thing about this game is that it is all about skill and how you play your cards right. Me, personaly you don't see a lot of free to play games with story modes. You rarely see that these days and the story is pretty good. Characters are good and the battles are intense in the stories. The next thing i like are the 6 different class choices because we all have different styles we use. Finaly, the cards: they are awsome and good to play. There are some card that are too op however, but there is always a weakness to a deck even if it looks invisible. Try out this game, you won't regret it."
Much better than HearthstoneBUT....Pro:+ Anime+ Collecting Cards <--- (the only reason why Im still playing)Con:- most cards are too OP- 1 minute Matches- brainless card game- Scripted - Pay to Win- go only face- no Antialiasing- bad Graphic- really bad PC Port- ugly UI- no Chat- no Spectate ModeDon´t put real Money into it... game is dying.
"Hearthstone without paywalls.But in exchange you get a extremely rigid meta where a single deck outright dominates everything, also overpowered cards that needs nerfing every month.Give and take you get some you lose some."
"Shadowverse is pretty decent. Basically a hearthstone ripoff done well, with a unique flair and interesting mechanics. At the current stage, the game is in my opinion heavily unbalanced (Haven is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, Swordbanner is dumb and too cheap, Aggro bats/loli bats is super boring, Dshift is overdone, etc etc). Balancing issues aside, there's a lot of fun to be had with the vs-AI, the unique Arena style matching and making a deck. When you finish the tutorial, the game gives you THIRTY-FIVE free packs (That's 8 cards in each!), a total of 280 cards. This is super helpful to kickstart you into the fun, but it may overwhelm newer players.Regardless, the game is pretty kino and I give it my recommendation. 8/10 its alright."
"I'll be reviewing this game based on facts and my gameplay experience-PROS-Good Graphics-Easy To Learn-Fun-Single Player Campain is Good-not p2w (unless buying 100 card packs is p2w... but no cards can just give you unlimited power)-Multiplayer is typical win or lose depends on your skill-visual effects actually makes the game more fun plus most card games dont have this :P-CONS-2nd player has some advantages including 1 extra evolve, 2 extra cards i kinda see this abit of a draw back to multiplayer-Some characters have such a hard line ups that you cant do much... (some people complain about Eris)-Cant change settings till you finish Tutorial, kinda find it annoying (ignore this if you dont mind much)-Missions,Achievements,Campain and Score reward seems to be the only way to get card packs without paying anything, for the first 100 hours you'll have lots of rewards and such i'm sure but after you play longer and longer i'm seeing a falloff in card packs which would mean you'll need to pay later to get decent amount of card packs..."
"I mean, I am not a card game expert, but game is somewhat skill intensive and there are a lot of waifus. Balance patches are usually kinda quick and the developers literally shower you with free packs. Remember this is the most popular in Asia, don't be followed that it is niche in the west."
"been playing this game for quite a while and have been able to stay cometative without paying any money.I tried many other card games but none are as enjoyable as this one, and they have lots of events  too.Even if you just like collecting waifus this game has some of the best9/11 would crash again"
"Super recommended, just a must play or at least try :) i would rate 10/10 if not more.Just the fact that i play for several month and never had a reason to complain about anything in the game :)But what ist it ? Its Hearthstone just better less rng cheaper cards and the awesome evolve mechanic ok ive talked to much go check it out :))"
"Shadowverse is a game much like Hearthstone where you play against an opponent using interactive cards. This game has wonderful visuals and the voice overs are well done to help drive the story. It offers a daily log in bonus, full story, and VS game mode. This is a great time killer and I have thoroughly enjoyed what I've played so far! I definitely recommend this game!https://youtu.be/8DlsQNhB3qo "
"A competent Hearthstone-like with its own unique and interesting mechanics and ""is being developed with a goal of minimal RNG"". Classes are diverse and each have multiple styles of play. Rewards and achievements provide longevity to the game and the business model is very generous. One small caveat is the ""localization"" which modifies a leader portrait, a few card names, and having no simple way to switch to Japanese voices within the game menu (there is a workaround in the Guides section though which involves replacing game files). Other than that, it's a pretty solid CCG with design influences from Magic the Gathering which is not a surprise since professional players like 2011 World Champion Jun'ya Iyanaga are part of the development team."
"Do i recommend this game? Real answer is : Depends... (reason below)Background, i play tcg games mainly Magic the gathering (commander deck (100 card))I find Shadowverse really fun compared to Hearthstone,i will only recoomend this game if you can stand competitive card gaming, else it's not that muchwhich i actually don't but i still enjoy the gameplay even i'm weak at this game i can't clear chapter 7 yet im trying lelit be nice if they actually give us some ruppies from unranked/practice game or just continue playing solo campaign games....Card art : 9/10Card / Character(leader) animation : 10/10Gameplay : 9/10 ( reminds me so much of warstorm some how)they give quite alot of tickets for drawing cards which is really great....still waiting for guides for deck making instead of those costy onesoverall i will give this a 8/10 "
"I must say, this game is pretty well done. You ought to try it. It's bascially a pretty good variant/clone of Magic the Gathering / Hearthstone. There are a few tweaks here and there, like Evolving and Shadows. The main objective of the game is still the same, bash the enemy hero's life to zero before he does it to you first. You don't have a hero power unlike Hearthstone. Gameplay wise,you have a deck of 40 cards and start draw a hand of 3 cards. The difference is that first player gets 2 evolve tokens while the second player gets 3 evolve tokens and draws 2 cards on their first turn. Subsequently, each player draws 1 card per turn.Mechanics for each class are listed below.However, caveat emptor, it is still a pay to win game.Note: The Granblue Fantasy and Rage of Bahamut sleeves are free. Game is developed and published by Cygames.15 November 2016: I'm changing my review to ""Negative"". It's horrible. When you look at the overpowered Legendaries, you understand that this game is just way too Pay To Win to be viable. 12 August 2017: Saw the Wonderland Dreams expansion. Campaign is now up to level 14.10 January 2018: Portalcraft is new but it's not revolutionary. It's just an additional effect for cards that depends on whether your deck has an even number of cards. Yuwan resembles Jace Beleren a lot. It's the hoodie and the character design. Both hero powers are about drawing cards but there is tiny difference since Jace doesn't care if your deck is even or odd.12 November 2018: 5000 crystals for $80.... Each prebuilt deck cost 500 crystals... Each prebuilt deck costs $8....  Darkness Evolved, Rise of Bahamut, Tempest of the Gods, Wonderland Dreams, Starforged Legends,Chronogenesis, Dawnbreak, Nightedge, Brigade of the Sky,Omen of the Ten...PROS1. Multi-system LinkYou can play this game on any device with just 1 code. You can port it anywhere, from your mobile to your PC.2. Graphics and SoundBeautiful. I love the art style and even the voice overs. They even have a beautiful deck presentation. It's a rondel of all your cards.3. AnimationYour hero winces in pain when they get attacked 4. Auto Deck CreationJust choose a Hero and you can automatically make a deck. It's already been done but it's still a plus point. E.g. wod3 is a randomly generated Forestcraft Deck. wtdj.5. Interaction with ObjectsYou can click on objects on the battlefield to make them move or glow, just like Hearthstone E.g. Golem in the lab, the pentacle in the Sacred Hall6. VarietyShadowverse starts you off with 7 Heroes. Most of the hero decks are very mechanically different from the Hearthstone but I think that a frame of reference will be as follows.a. Arisa (Forestcraft)                 ---- Hunter? Forestcraft plays on a 2 or more cards played this turn mechanic. If you play 2 or more cards, certain cards will give an added ability when played. This means that order of play matters a lot on your turn. b. Erika (Swordcraft)                 ---- Paladin?Commanders, Officers and Followers. Cards have a Commander trait that allows them to buff their followers. It's a bit weird as even Amulets can have the Commander trait. E.g. Royal Bannerc. Isabelle (Runecraft)              ---- Mage?Spellboost. Similar to Forestcraft, it feeds on more cards being played. If you play a spell, cards with Spellboost get a permanent bonus on top of their normal ability. So, you can keep on adding more and more Spellboosts onto a single card before it's played. Earth Rite. Cards can use an amulet called an Earth Sigil to boost their power. You must have an Earth Sigil to sacrifice first.d. Rowen (Dragoncraft)            ---- Druid?Overflow. If you have 7 or more orbs (mana crystals), cards with Overflow gain a bonus ability.e. Luna (Shadowcraft)              ---- Priest?Shadows and Necromancy. Shadows are another currency. Whenever YOUR units/amulets die or you cast a spell, you gain Shadow. You can use Shadow to boost your cards with the Necromancy trait. Sadly, the Shadows are used automatically so order of card play matters a lot. It reduces the strategic choice greatly.f. Urias (Bloodcraft)                  ---- Warlock?Vengeance. If your leader drops to 10 health or below, cards with Vengeance gain a bonus. High risk, high reward. It is not triggered upon 10 damage, you need 10 or less defense (hit points).g. Eris (Havencraft)                   ---- Shaman?Countdown. Amulets in the Havencraft deck have Countdown, which means that they will only trigger after a certain number of turns. Once they trigger, they will usually summon a creature with high stats. However, it can't attack on the turn it was summoned unless it has Storm.h. (Portalcraft)Even or Odd. It depends on the number of cards in your deck.CONS1. Pay To WinThe in-game cash currency is called Crystals. Interestingly enough, Cygames put in a limit on the amount you can buy based on your age. 15 and under : 250016-19 : 500020 and above : Unlimited The best deal is at 5000 crystals for $80 and 1 pack of 8 cards costs 100 crystals. So, the best price per pack is (80/50) = $1.60 per pack. The standard price with grindable currency is 1 ticket or 100 rupies for 1 pack.2. CraftingCrafting is an extension of point 1. Why do you craft? Because the game does not give you the cards to create a fair game, so you have to destroy your own cards to make Vials. Depending on the rarity of the card, you will get variations in the amount of Vials from destroying it or how much it costs to craft it.Bronze liquefies/costs 10/50 VialsSilver liquefies/costs 50/200 VialsGold liquefies/costs 250/800 VialsLegendary liquefies/costs 1000/3500 Vials3. Hard to Differentiate Spell and CreatureSince the stats are at the bottom of the card, I have to highlight the card to see if it's a spell or a creature.4. Random Number GeneratorMy guess is that as that the level goes up, the easier it is to get all of the same cards. Perhaps, it is a balancing factor?5. Deck Separation by ClassYou can't combine them so it limits the different plays. It's probably a hand-me-down effect from Magic the Gathering's 5 colour separation.6. No Trading of Cards, No Illusion of ValueSince there is no physical copy of the card, the game is far easier to create. However, there is no trading system for the cards. This removes the social, business and value creation aspects of the CCG system. Without a secondary market, the cards lose the illusion of value that Magic the Gathering has. While Magic cards are simply cardboard and the number of rares are dictated to Carta Mundi, the false physical rarity creates an illusion of value for the players.7. Account Losses When Server Rollbacks/UpdatesAs with my account, when the server made a rollback, I lost most of the progress on my campaign. Cards probably went missing as well. Unlike the traditional medium, there is no physical backup when the cards are removed from your account. You just lose everything. NEUTRAL1. EvolveAfter 5 turns, each player is allowed to evolve 1 card with their evolution points. Evolving allows you to upgrade a card so that it can gain better stats or abilities and attack enemy creatures immediately. The first player is given 2 evolution points and the second player is give 3 evolution points. Evolving is basically just a free +2/+2, Haste Planeswalker ability with the condition that you can't attack the enemy hero.I am not sure what to say about this. I thought it would be a unique racial/Hero power. E.g. Arisa would do evolutions, Urias would do something else.2. Mechanically Similar Abilities to HearthstoneAmbush - StealthFanfare - BattlecryLast Words - Death RattleStorm - RushRush - (Peculiar mechanic. You can activate on the turn it was summoned but you can't attack the opponent directly.)Bane - DeathtouchClash - FightAmuletsEarth RiteBanishCountdown"
"As a Hearthstone vet (played since beta back in 2014) that got tired of all the increasing RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t added with every new content release, I can safely say that Shadowverse in its current state is a much better, and most importantly, more fun (unless you're casual and love ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG heavy mechanics), game than Hearthstone. If I had to compare between the two, I would say that Shadowverse is similar to vanilla Hearthstone but with its own  interesting twist in the Evolve system. Don't get me wrong, as a card game, some RNG is still there (for example minion and spell damage pings, topdecks). However, there is a lot less of it (no Yogg-Saron or Shredder-like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that can randomly and wildly swing games, fewer damage ping cards) compared to Hearthstone in its current state.So if you like TCGs and online card games like Hearthstone, but dislike the casual, heavy luck dependent aspect of it, try this game. Don't let the anime art style turn you off if you're not a fan of it; try it for a few hours and I can almost guarantee you that you've found a new card game to play."
"I enjoy this game much more than Heartstone. F2P player can easily compete with cash player and the farming process is much more rewarding than Hearthstone.Arena is even more awesome. 5 match each run, reward increase exponentially for each win. You break even at 2.5 win, double your investment at 4 win and almost triple it at 5 win.Evolve is the unique of this game and I believe it's the best mechanism I have ever seen in card game. It helps the second player regain the tempo lost by letting your monster attacking immediately the turn they are played with a restriction of going face.9.5/10."
"Guys, I have to say that Shadowverse is the best card game I have ever played. I started playing SV on iPad since it released in June. Honestly, the basic concept is like Hearthstone, but it got different game mode, brilliant characters Japanese design, evolve point, many free card pack (many means 'REALLY' many!) and many other different features.One more thing, the gaming atmosphere is petty balance right now. You won't see a character who can surely kick down every other character. Every playing style can counter each other. So don't worry :)"
"This game is amazing. At first, it reminded me of Hearthstone, but I soon realized that this game clearly holds its own. The Evolution system is insane and can turn the tide of a battle in moments. The different classes are varied, but their cards allow for lots of flexibility for your own personal story. And most surprisingly, the story is both interesting and well voice-acted. You actually get attached to the characters and their own personal storylines."
"Solid card game. It may appear to be just another cash grabbing ""Free"" to play card game clone of something like hearthstone, and it may very well be for all I know, but mechanically I feel this card game does a better job than others.There's a mix of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering elements embeded into this card game's core, with an interesting complexity of a game like Yu-Gi-Oh at its high end. While overall, the mechanics are simple, they are woven in a way to keep things interesting and heated the entire battle. As a game goes on, the plays and comboniations accelerate eachand every turn. Its hard to have complete control over the game, as it seems that a player can always recover, overall balanced.If I had one complaint, I do feel like going second most of the time is pretty busted."
"This really is a ""Meh"" review.Hearthstone-esk, its easy to pick up and simple to learn. Though still provides some good alternate gameplay to add its own special feel and tactics.The various decks have a unique playstyle that caters to its specific cards, and force the player to think about how to abuse it, or quickly lose the match. This provides the players with a set of challanges when deckbuilding, and strats, that you dont find in Hearthstone and other virtual CCGs.However, there does seem to be a problem with some of the decks, most notably one of them. This deck is a timebomb style of deck. Weak at first, but after a few turns, explodes and overwhelms. There isnt a flaw in that type of gameplay, untill you realise that the cards meant to shut it down, are few and far between.The game is fun, but needs more time to get flushed out, more options for counterplay and the like, would very much be welcome and would vastly improve this game."
If you have tried hearthstone before you should definitely give this game a try.  The game is very polished both in gameplay and graphics. It does not feel impossible to make a large collection of cards and the games feel a lot more skill based then the RNG clown fiesta that hearthstone is.
"This game looked like it wouldn't be great, but after playing it and getting to understand the game, it's not that bad. It's a great game and fun to play and I think everyone else would enjoy it if they like these type of games."
"I didn't know where to put this review. I've gone from Pokemon to MTG to Hearthstone to a brief stint in Duelyst to this, and I don't really think it's the strongest out there. Like Hearthstone, it's very snowball-ey. where aggro wins because they dictate trades. In a game like MTG, defenders control much more of the pace, which inherently allows slower decks to operate. The game also has a lot of pretty weird mechanics and busted cards, and while thats nice for a new player to know what the first card the should craft is, it's not really as fun as a diverse game. Similar to Patches in Hearthstone, it sucks the joy out of the game.However, despite all this, the ""gimmick"" of evolving guys is well done, and it feels more balanced than, say, the coin. Some mechanics are pretty solid, easy to learn, and reward both slow and fast decks. Ultimately, it's a good experience, but I like MTG and Hearthstone more than I do this game. If you don't have the budget for those games, though, this is a really F2P-friendly game that offers you so much reward if you put in the time, so for those players, this game is great. Tl;dr - good F2P and a good experience, but I prefer Hearthstone and MTG"
Lots of free cards on install which can give you enough card early on to make a strong deck without spending money on cards which gives quite a boost early on. The cards are also anime themed so its waifuable and that's a very important thing. And I'm glad kektar is finally over. I wonder what's the next overpowered deck.Edit: well atleast spawn is counterable
"I don't know if it's the strategy or the breasts but I'm definitely drawn intensely to this game. I've tried other card games before but this one really sticks like none other have. I'm actually every part of this game sans deck codes retrieved from fansites providing (nearly) unstoppable decktypes. I really wish people would play their way rather than build the same deck everybody else is using inspired by cheap garbage cards that are frustratingly overpowered, but this is something unavoidable even in physical card games especially now with the internet. People don't have a problem dropping a hundred dollars on a single card these days. They're crazy. And so are the pairs of melons on almost every card.Ten outta ten knockers."
"Better than Play Dota 2. Nice for casual gamer.Can do both PC and mobile.Need a slight accomodation for who use internet cafe, must reinstall 1st to play with own ID.For free gamer: u need alot time to farm this thing Called RUPEES to build up ure own deck.For who use cash to play : WELCOME TO GACHA WORLD, where there is 0,03% u get the CARD that u want.Happy Playing TCG.Bloodcraft User- Carnage "
"I'm someone who really enjoys Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, Duelyst, etc.  This game is at least on par with Hearthstone in everyway.  If you don't believe me there are plenty of other reviews that state something similar.  Just the addition of the Evolve mechanic alone adds all kinds of depth and options to gameplay.  A card can't be evolved till turn four.  The player who goes first gets to evolve twice per match, the other player three times.   A player can only evolve once per turn.  Every card has the ability to be ""Evolved."" Evolving sometimes gives a card a static +2/+2, sometimes it just adds new mechanics.  Also, that evolved creature even with summoning sickness can attack an enemy creature, but still cannot attack the general/hero.  If you've played ANY card game, you know how aweful it feels to draw a early game card at like turn ten.  Atleast you can evolve a 2/2 to a 4/4 and attack an enemy creature, in a desperate situation that might be enough.After the tutorial, which is striaghtforward and simple, you get 10 free packs of the standard block and each expansion.  Thats literally 40 packs of cards out the gate.  With those I got about 8 legendary cards and about 20 rares.  You will not be disadvanteged for coming into this game late.  Also it is way less grindy than Hearthstone.  You get 8 cards/Pack, you can earn gold way easier (packs are also 100 gold). I'm not someone who bases a games value on graphics/art but Shadowverse did a great job. Evolving also changes the card's art.   Most bronze cards just swap colors and add a few details.  Silver and up can have some suprisingly dynamic changes.  Also, if you care about this kind of thing, each form of the card will have seperate voice lines.  Some where generally etertaining, none so far have made me cringe.The single player mode has stories for each of the characters.  I've only played 5 missions for one of the characters, but I was suprisingly interested in the story.  There is more I can say, but just find out for yourself.What do you have to lose? It's free to play. "
"It's been a while since the last time I played card games.This game succesfully captured my heart and soul to play continously.The best thing in this game is the art! The girls are cute, the men are handsome *gosh*Easy to understand card effects, and generous amount of free cards.10/10 would stay in the game for a long time."
"So after messing around a bit i've come to the conclusion it's basically hearthstone with some new ways of play and based on cygames stuff. 10/10 would reccomend not as p2w heavy as i thought it would be, if at all. have yet to run into anything."
"I haven't really played that much so these are my preliminary thoughts on the game. Pros: +Rich solo experience w/ voice acting and good tutorials+generous f2p model+Evolve mechanic is interesting. Evolving is essentially upgrading a card that you have on the board. So a 1/3 evolves to a 3/5 and can attack creatures the turn that they're summoned. Board states become really volatile.+Each class feels unique and has a different playstyle+So far I haven't seen any coinflip cards ala RNGstone.Cons:-For some reason this game gives me really bad eyestrain. I don't know if it's all the sparkly particle effects or the way the turn notifications transition in and out.-It seems like going second is a bit too good, mostly because of the extra evolve you get. That way the person going second has the last say in deciding the board state up to a certain point. I don't like playing aggro/face decks so going first has little appeal to me.Notes:* You can change the resolution and set it to 60 FPS after you gain access to the home menu. This confused me when I launched the game at first because it was like 600x800 or something windowed and I couldn't find any graphics options in the menu.I recommend people check the game out as it is fairly decent but I can't play this anymore due to the eyestrain problem I mentioned earlier."
Very new player friendly and so much free content and single player content. This allows you to get straight into the game without the annoying overly grindy experience that a certain other card game is known for.
"I have played many card games, including the Heartstone,and i have to say that so far this card game has unique mechanics that no other game has,it needs skill to be played but also ( cause it is a card game) a bit of luck too.If u like card games and you havent played this one yet, then you are loosing some awesome stuff. ( my elo is 4100) "
"Highly recommend it to any CCG or TCG lovers out there. It has much more interactions/mechanics than HS or should i say RNGstone. Not to mention its easy to get yrself a decent deck with the 40++ free packs at the beginning and often enough the developers will give generous numbers of free pack tickets, not to mention, tons of waifus"
I really love this game and Cygames managed to nail what Hearthstone cannot achieve. Now they just need to introduce new mechanics along with new expansion sets and new multiplayer mode like 2 vs 2 or free for all four multiplayer mode.
"Pretty cool ccg. Entry level f2p is very generous. Check out the games reddit for guides, cheap decks to craft to begin with, and rerolling guides. (Apparently rerolling is a very popular thing for the best starts possible)OP decks battling OP decks. Pretty common at higher ranks. Netdecking to a whole new level, not just 2-3 meta decks every expac"
"Why should you try this?- actually very strategic game(easy to learn, difficult to master)- awesome art style- nice story campaign(short but fun and for every character)- nice music- good help for beginners(you will receive plenty of packs at the start)- LOLI(OMG,YES!)From what I saw, Shadowverse is definitely worth a try. If you think that it's similar to the hearthstone, you are wrong. It has a different approach and mechanics are fresh and fun.  "
"Let's get the obvious thing out of the way: yes, this is a Hearthstone clone. If you've ever played Hearthstone before, the interface during a match is essentially identical, almost down to the animations and sound effects. The crafting system also follows a similar template, as does the solo campaign that serves as a lengthy tutorial. However, and this important -- while Cygames has copied most of the look and feel, they've also created enough different keywords and game mechanics that it's not just a reskinned version of Hearthstone. This is a different situation from that Hex TCG that basically took Magic: The Gathering and just changed all the names.If you're already deep into Hearthstone, there isn't really much here that might entice you to switch. Maybe if you prefer the style, which is anime through-and-through (complete with bad English dubbing). But if you're new to CCGs, this is a good F2P title for you -- there aren't that many cards yet, so you're less likely to be overwhelmed, and won't need to grind/pay as much to catch up to veteran players."
"Shadowverse has a lot going on for it. The devs are extremely generous, between the packs that are given to you at the beginning and the ones you can buy with the gold from the basic missions you get more than 50 packs to open, and every pack has 8 cards so you get a pretty decent collection from the get go.The game has 7 classes, each one with a very distinctive identity, and all of them have decks that are meta. Even the best current deck can be countered by a lot of things.I really recommend Shadowverse if you are into digital card games."
"This game is very comperable to Hearthstone. The anime may be a little bit much at first but you get used to it. The evolve mechanic gives the game a ton of depth and rewards thinking ahead and deck composition. Also, the game has much less RNG than it's main competitor, Hearthstone. I have put maybe 30 hours into this game before the steam release and I must suggest you try it if you enjoy or think you will enjoy cards games.Also the devs give away packs and other product all the time. Way more than any other game I've ever played"
"So to compare it to every other Card game I've ever played on a digital device, it is just an extremely fair game. It doesn't rely too strongly on RNG other than the normal card game draw. The evolve also adds a new level to the game that others lack. On top of this, it gives you so many card packs simply for playing the game. it also has a campaign where you learn the main strategy behind each class, and also gives rewards for completing each level. On top of this, you have achievements, a score, and daily missions, which all further give you rewards. Then there's their alternate version of Arena, which is just a set of 5 matches where the more you win, the bigger your prize gets, as opposed to something like Hearthstone, where you play until you reach the max reward or get your third loss. I also like the ranked system a lot.All in all, very impressed with this game. New players can pick it up, play around with all the cards, and generally have a lot to work with right from the get go. Recommended for anyone who is at all interested interested in games like MTG and Hearthstone."
"If you like Hearthstone, you'll like this game as it's pretty much the anime equivallent. I enjoy just how very free to play this game actually is, as it almost chucks packs at you on a regular basis let along about 30 packs just for completing the tutorial. Now, as a card addict, I love opening packs even in digital form and the visuals for pack opening is wonderful. I also enjoy how the story modes play as Visual Novels with little card games. I'm a person fan of Luna, the Shadowcraft class. The cards are also rather interesting with wonderous graphics which change when evolved. Along with each class having it's own special trait e.g. Shadowcraft has a Shadow counter for Necromancy cards or Bloodcraft has a vengace counter. I highly reccomend this game if you want an anime hearthstone with it's own interesting characters and card setup."
"Shadowverse feels so good to play. I especially love the artwork, the variety of cards, and the fact that it share characters with Granblue Fantasy and Rage of Bahamut since being from the same company. Gameplay is fun and the mechanics are simple to learn. I can't get enough of the surprises from opening new packs everytime!"
"been playing Shadowverse on and off for several years now, since the Rise of Bahamut (third) expansion, and I can say that it has its highs and lows. The issue can be that sometimes these can span for entire months at a time. There have been moments where the meta is so frustrating to play through that I need to stop playing for a while (I'm at rank A1 in both rotation and unlimited, which isn't the highest tier but high enough to be around most meta decks). Some might find that statement to be the mark of a bad game, but I don't think it's too discouraging. I've played several other online TCGs, all of which I've quit and for a while and have basically barred myself from ever going back to (unless I dump a bunch of money into them). One of the main benefits of Shadowverse is the amount of generosity that the developers give to players. At the release of every expansion, you get 10 packs. When you start the game for the first time, you get 10 packs from every rotation set (this makes getting into unlimited a bit more difficult for newer players, but rotation is the better environment to start in anyway). Anytime the servers are down for changes, at least a few packs (3-5) are given to everyone for the downtime. Because of this, as well as the rates that packs/gold/legendaries are earned, Shadowverse has been the only online TCG I've played that I feel I can keep coming back to. To this day, I've only spend $7 USD on the game (on a special offer) and I've never felt like I've been barred from playing the deck I want to play. Sure, you might have to sacrifice a lot of cards in order to craft the ones you need, but unless you're keen on playing every single class, this usually won't feel too crippling. As I said, the meta can be either balanced or, well, not so much. Some of the classes have been consistently powerful, while others can be under appreciated for quite a while. There's always at least some variety of decks in the meta, and the developers SEEM to be pushing away from some the more problematic card abilities (at least as of Alterverse, the newest expansion as of writing this). If you're curious to try the game, then I encourage you do give it a shot. Playing for free is far less disadvantaged than it is in other TCGs, so for that reason alone it's worth it, even if you're just curious."
"I quite like this game, but I have two minor gripes with it:1. Sometimes the art gets a bit too much ""anime"", like having a Veteran Tamer be a cute, young, and cheery girl, who doesn't look like she's had much experience with the world in general, just as one example. (The art itself is fine, just feels out of place.)2. The fact that 9 out of 10 girls who look to be over the age of 12 has either: Enormous breasts, Clothes that are revealing just for the sake of being revealing (aka Image-tag 'Unconvincing_Armor'), or a Push-up bra?While it can look good, most of the times it just makes me glad I live alone and don't have to justify playing it to anyone, because the issue brought up with #2 just makes many Followers look bloody silly! (What I mean is that I like to look at pretty people just as much as the next guy, but not when I'm trying to play a regular game, it just makes it ridiciolus, and all cards played will have a prefix-thought along the lines of ""Oh for fu-..*chuckle*...Japanese people...*sigh*. Not to forget to mention that IF I wanted to do something for the sake of looking at pretty stuff, it is not like I have nothing else than this game to choose from X'D.)Other than this though, the card game is still pretty fun (except for when you get into one of those ""I play a Follower - Next Turn - Opponent kills it, then plays a Follower - Next Turn - I kill their Follower - a.s.o-deadlocks), and it still looks absolutely amazing! Also it is free, and you get (as of when writing this [2017-12-01]) a lot of Tickets for Booster Packs after finishing the Tutorial!"
"So much free stuff,like a ridiculous amount, they just really want you to enjoy their game, only wish I had time to play more.Game mechanics are fresh and interesting too, looking forward to playing more :)"
"been in the hook with this game from the beta, would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in card games, every craft feel completely diffrent from the others as it should be, most of the time i been playing ""casually"" didn't put many hours daily (~2 hours) or sometimes not play at all and i can craft anything and can make a ''wallet"" deck every month if i wanted too without spending a cent, as i said before the f2p expirence is very good duo to many things one of them is the silver cards ratio/value is way off the roof, the artwork keep getting better every expansion, balance wise the game always shifts and don't feel stale but thank god for the monthly balance patch (as every online competitive game devs should do) which keeps the game even more fresh everytime, the game is still fun and keeps getting better every time."
"While this game may suffer from typical japanese waifu/husbando tropes I'd say this game is quite one of the best TCG/CCG games out there if you want depth and flexibility. The main story suffers from the same issue mentioned above but at least it's something compared to say Hearthstone which just puts Warcraft lore into a blender.+ Lots of diverse cards/playstyles avail.+ Awesome art direction and sound presentation overall.+ Crossplatform for say Android/iOS.+ Free stuff offered compared to say HS which blatantly DEMANDS you buy packs for $$$.+ Easy to get into as a noob/casual, as the tutorial levels scale accordingly.+- Suffers from waifu/husbando trope. Which is a hit or miss for some I suppose ¯\_(ツ)_/¯+- Playing competetive can be either fun (and/)or frustrating as it doesn't use say Blizzards typical 50/50 W/L ratio system.- Minor complaint for Android graphic settings but I guess that's just nitpicking in my case.While it's not as deep or time-consuming as Magic. At least it's miles head of HS in terms of overall presentation and execution."
"Really enjoyed this game in the beginning, but as of late, Cygames has pulled some really questionable balancing moves, so I can't really recommend it.Not entirely sure what they were thinking by completely killing off whatever viability neutral decks had left in the meta right before its next expansion, Star Forged Legends. Cygames is probably trying to chase people off the neutral meta entirely(or what was left of it), forcing people to build according to their meta renewal after the new expansion rolls around, by artificially creating imbalance, so that people will keep moving on and have to sink in funds. Since this isn't a new trend from them before every major expansion. (but it was never to this bad of an extent.)Overall a good game, but bad balancing, and questionable business practices. This will be a negative from me.Edit: For all you ""vets"" who think SFL is ""balanced"" and has a diverse meta, PDK Dragoncraft: Reaching Grand Master with 77.4% (141/41) Win Rate and a 17 game win streak, says plenty otherwise.  Deck [shadowverse.gamepress.gg] for those that are interested."
"This is one of the best card game out there. Its simple but deep enough, with each char have a unique style of play. They even have unique story mode for each character if you want to start learn about each char without getting curb-stomped online. The game gave enough card pack to start, so you can get quite a good deck quickly. The art style is gorgeous, though its not for everyone taste (Anime)."
"This game has its quirks. 20 HP life means aggro rusn rampant but thanks to the new expansion many different types of decks are now viable. Lots of fun and if you get good, you can smash easily :)"
"This game is fun if you're looking for a new way to play the same type of deck, well in this case the same Leader(since you can make a lot of different deck styles to suit your taste) and see if it will work or not, making decks from scratch is fun cuz you can find many ways to make combos, or just do what almost every person in these game do, copy paste internet decks and go for the win(beware even if you copy a deck doesnt mean you always win, you need to know how to play that type of deck) and of course always have fun >.<b"
"Yes, the art is a little heavy on the *ahem* PLOT, but Shadowverse manages to be a genuinely enjoyable ccg experience that isn't completely miserable for a free player. If you're smart with vialing, the initial packs you get for completing the tutorial (10 from each expansion, plus another 28 packs worth of gold should you defeat all the elite AI.) should give you enough to work with to create a half decent deck. I've got 4  solid decks and I've only been actively playing for a few months (most of that time is on mobile, so that's why my steam playtime for this game is so low. Cygames is also incredibly communicative and actively listens to its playerbase. If any online card game is worth your time, it's this one."
"It's really fast paced CCG everyone plays with aggro decks game almost always ends on turn 5-8 when someone will play cheap 10/10 dude. It's so unusual for me, because I'm fan of control decks in HS. It has nice economy. It throws in your face like 60 packs (10 of each expansion and 20 standard. Each pack contains 8 cards) just after finishing tutorial, plus if you complete story mode  - you receive even more. Try it if you ever played any CCG before."
"-actual fun card game with interactive cards, none of that hearthstone swashburgler or babbling book bs-actually has class identity-only have to play a week or so to get a competitive deck-art is animu and there are tons of waifus(most important factor)"
"Shadowverse is an attacker's choice collectible card game which draws many parallels to Hearthstone. The biggest difference with Shadowverse and its competitors is that it's extremely free to play friendly, easily the best in its genre.An important mechanic which allows it to differentiate itself from other similar games is the evolve mechanic. This option which is primarily used as a way to swing tempo back and forth as well as balance going first vs second opens up roughly in the middle part of each match. While limited in uses, it allows followers to attack enemy followers immediately upon being played as well as activate any evolve specific effects. I find that it does its job relatively well (it could be better), although aggressive decks can easily win before such an option can turn the tides of battle.The arena mode, which is named Take Two, brings an interesting take to drafted decks. Instead of picking one card at a time, Take Two forces you to pick a pair of cards at a time. Do you pick a game-winning card even if it's paired with a terrible one or do you go with the 2 average cards? Maybe all 4 cards are awful, which pair could be considered better? Questions like that bring an additional strategic layer to a tried-and-true drafting formula.Something that can be considered a strength or a weakness completely dependant on each individual is the games heavy anime aesthetic. Because the art comes from many different artists (similar to Magic The Gathering), it can cause consistency issues.Another important strength in this game compared to its competitors is from their developers. The game goes through balance patches monthly and the developers themselves are very transparent about their thoughts and future plans for the game.Easily the weakest part of the game is the UI. While the game originated on mobile and its largest playerbase is Japan's mobile market, I do not believe that is a good enough excuse for the UI to not be improved upon for the PC version.It's a relatively minor complaint but that's what ends up happening when the rest of the game is extremely solid."
Shadowverse: Lemme just play a couple cards and completely skip ya turn.. twice.Seems fair enough.Incredibly unbalanced.Somewhat funI think it is the start of the gameIs it my turnFair play in sightHardly said as everEver instead was the moneySpent on the cardPress a buttonYou winForever was the standingA game that lasted 60 secondForever for ShadowverseWho would stand for a secondGame determined by starting handDo not pick a fair deckFor you will get wreckedIf ever dished a sliverYour butt would beFor dinner 
"Overall I would recommend this game. There are some downsides, but overall it is a descent card game worth try out.Many people compare this against hearthstone. The two game are very similar indeed but the feel of play style are slight different. One major change is there are no hero ability but a universal evolve ability, which makes the game's tempo very interesting.The best part of the game is probably the single player mode, which serves as a very interesting tutorial and a good place to try out new decks. Also it gives enough free packs + gold for new player to get a quick start. However, at one point during the campaign the AI's deck has a serious power jump, forcing the player to either to grind enough gold or spend money to upgrade their decks.Mechanics wise, each ""class"" is different enough and has multiple gimiks, makes it interesting enough to explore. However, as for deck building, I still find there are much limitation and overall the number of decks viable are pretty low. The quality gap between each rarety is also quite large, so a new player really needs to spend some time (or money) before jumping into versus games."
"EDIT: Starforged Expansion came out. Game is still absolutely miserable because of power creep, with multiple problematic cards created through multiple expansions. Still don't recommend it. For 4 expansions in a row now going first is a huge advantage (roughly 10%-20% winrate difference depending on your deck) for nearly every deck in the game. Old problematic cards continue to be untouched. Basically same old problems new expansion.If you're a competitive card game player stay far, far away. Power creep through 4 expansions, soon to be 5, has made the game into two people trying to out solitaire each other. The devs have recently started nerfing problematic cards, but honestly it's far too little far too late. All of the meta factions have extremely uninteractive decks and playstyles, the game isn't about outplaying your opponents in any degree, you're only outdrawing them.If you're looking to play casually the game is fun in low ranks when nobody has the expensive cards necessary to play meta decks. So if you don't plan on playing seriously you can probably have fun."
"Well, what do you know? There IS a legit CCG behind all that lewd 2D anime girls you enjoy so much that you're already looking for that patch even before installing it!Haven't played much yet and you will probably get a better, more realistic view from those negative reviews with more than 300 hours of gameplay, but hey, it's is pretty generous for the newbie. I also like how the mechanic changes for each ClassCraft thingy and the HUD reflects that. That's a nice concept.It's okay. Can't hurt, right? I mean, you know when to stop, you're already a grown ma- wait, I don't know who you are. Anyway, take care. Buy napkins, I don't know."
"Haha Hearthstone. Dev's listen, and encourage varied deck building. You don't havve to follow the Meta you could literally go on long win streaks with most decks(as long as they're solid, and have a purpose and stuff). For example I played alot of control forest(tier 2) and went on a 21 win streak. Plus the upcoming update is introducing lots of fun things like rotation.Simply better than Hearhtstone."
"beautiful art style, interesting concept with different choices of playstyle from a range of different classes.The game system is deep and rewarding, pretty much the japanese version of Hearthstone with its own charm."
"I suck B U T T at this game, but I can see how people can find it fun. Personally, these types of games aren't really my type but the free 10 packs for new players that is guaranteed to give you some decent cards so you aren't at a complete disanvantage just for starting out. Certainly, the tutorials for each deck and the game itself introduce you to strategies rather than throwing you under the bus and telling you good luck, it just depends on whether you can take this information and utilize it or understand how certain cards work together, etc. I'd recommend it for people who like to strategize and collect cards, but because I suck at the game I can't really say I'll play much of it. tbh the only strategy games I like are Fire Emblem-like games. : "")"
"The game plays really well, especially because of the ""evolve"" mechanic.You get an incredible amount of free cards at the beginning and from some early quests. This makes the first few hours a blast.However, the second player has a HUGE advantage, making some games feel like a coin-toss between who has to start.Also, the meta sucks. If you don't like playing aggro, midrange or zoo, you are in bad luck pretty much. Because of the lack of comeback mechanics and AoE (except for Bahamut, which is a legendary) there is almost no way of stopping the bleeding as a control deck.  I really wanted this to be the CCG that really hooks me, and it did for a while. Sadly, I was dissapointed by the meta and cards that are in the card pool right now."
"Honestly, I loved the game when I was first playing it. The stories entangled me into the events, I loved the quick style-like gameplay, and the art is definately something that shouldn't be ignored.I took a break from the game for maybe a month due to school and what not, and I slowly grew to hate the game.I tried playing ranked with my Shadowcraft decks, and every fight I ran into was someone running something I had no idea how to fight, or who knew what I wanted to do and got around it in a way to make me response a D at best. So I thought if I played some take two that I would have more luck (getting to try new cards or new formats I couldn't run against bots). Unfortunately, every I fight in take two is a rank of a purple heart with at least 1 star, and loss can be expected at turn 9, with them at a perfect 20 health.Don't get me wrong, the single player options are great, the different levels of bots that were just added are awesome for testing decks, but it feels of you aren't a hardcore player with 3 copies of every card in the game, or someone who is willing to try to play for basicly the legendary cards that give you the insta wins you're better off on story mode and trying to complete the non pvp missions."
"Pro- free to play- grind a bit and have everything , yay- Best art- Cross platform- 7 archtyped deck depend on play style and waifu- even if you want to pay, pack is cheap. deal is cheap. - a lot of free card- if you mod a bit, japanese voice also a if you feel weeb enough.Con- 404 balance not found- F*ck RNG- Game keep p***ing you even you deck is good , you card will never come and enemy have everything to counter you. Even you play meta deck RNG can push you to 1win per 10 lost (yes, it easily happen since this game start with 3 cards draw one each turns. game usually end without see 2/3 of you deck. but that thing also common in others mobile card game.)- Bad ranking system but game keep kicking you to play it.-Patch every month no much viable, everyone play witch.others.- 1/3 time spend in this game is waiting.- If you life is good ,everyone love you. Try this game. It free ,no one hurt.- only PvP mode for now, can't do quest in solo like HS.* fix : Have solo quest now but reward is low.- Not invite any friend to this RNG hell is best idea."
"Best TCG i've ever played, far better than hearthstone, interesting new mechanics, constant updates, deck variety, mostly balanced, every class has at least one tier 1 deck archetype (exept forest, becuase who cares about fairies kek).Legendaries have a decent drop rate (1 every 5/8 packs).Crafting system is fair, the only thing i'm not happy with are seer's globes that allow you to craft animated cards, but are WAY too expensive for what you actually get in return, i don't get the attention that the animation gets, like is some sort of incredible thing, it's just nicer to see your favourite cards animated, but it's not worth to waste all of your resources to get only one card.Arena is ok i guess, nice rewards, classes aren't really balanced in arena, but the decks are rng so there's nothing much you can do about it, just choose classes that are strong in arena like sword.The community is nice, content creators are entertaining and people always come up with a new meme deck to have fun with on a daily base. Of course there will always be people ranting about nerfs and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but most of them don't understand the mechanics of the game and the consequences that a nerf bring.Card artworks are amazing, can be enjoyed even if you aren't a weeb.I would honestly give this game 8.5/10Worth to play, or at least to try it out.AlsoT O O  S L O W"
The most generous card game I have ever played. It literally hands you packs as soon as you start and gives you alot of missions in order to buy some more packs. The game offers alot of factions which are very unique by themselves. Every faction has differing mechanics that is very refreshing to play.
"Error 100 still not fixed after what seems like a year - can't even get past the tutorial without getting booted out, neither is the account creation/login working correctly. If devs aren't willing to fix dire issues after this long, people shouldn't be willing to play."
"TLDR: Do not play this game, it's pay-to-win and you'll spend double on this card game than you would others.I tried so hard to like this game. There were some cool things like the anime art styles, the evolve mechanic, a single player mode, and achievements that serve a purpose. Yet through all that, I grew to hate this game.First off, the biggest problem is that this game is pay to win. Legendaries and Gold cards are necessary to win, no questions asked. The average player is not good enough to progress without them. Whales throwing money at this game will always have the advantage. The power creep in rarity spikes at Gold and Legendary, more than it should ordinarily. With the ability to put three of ANY card in your deck, it makes this problem all the more glaring. Speaking of legendaries...Card drops are another problem, they never give you any legendaries. I suspect there's some kind of system that gives you better legendary rates if you use crystals, the in-game currency, but I have no way of proving that. What I do know is that Tempest of the Gods has double the legendaries of previous expansions. I saved up 4000 Gold and bought 40 packs. Each pack has 8 cards, multiply that by 40 and I got 320 cards. Of those 320 only 2 were legendaries. I've opened half that amount of packs and got more legendaries in other games. There is some tampering going on. This is the second biggest pool of legends in this expansion and I only got 2? Out of 320 cards? a reasonable game would have seen me with 5, 4 if a pity timer was implemented. And if you decide to bit the bullet and buy packs so you'll get a fair shot at these better cards, you can buy 28 packs in this game for the price of 40 in Hearthstone. Factor in that Hearthstone has a pity-timer to guarantee that you walk away with a legendary every 20 packs and caps it at one per deck versus Shadowverses three per deck with no pity timer.The RNG in this game is way off. You'll often find that you mulligan a card into your deck just to draw it again or draw your highest cost cards without fail. It's not like I was playing a top heavy deck either. I played Bloodcraft aggro, a deck that relies on getting lots of low cost minions out quickly. I had 4 cards the cost 6 play point and one that cost 7 but those cards would constantly make up half of my opening hand. And any 'random' effects will see the best possible outcome most of the time. This went for me too, a random damage effect would happen and I would have a 1 in 5 chance of hitting the best target. I or my opponent would always hit that best target.It's just not worth it. There's probably an awesome card game online for hopeless weeaboo trash like myself, but it's not this one. Save your money and patience."
"i have spent five million gajillion dollars on this game to get an animated legendary, my wife has left me, my kids hate me, the cops are closing into my location, i dont have much time please tell my children daddy will always lo"
-Recommended by friend to play anime-liked cardgames-Plays Anime Hearthstone-Finds Anime Hearthstone not like Hearthstone at all (less RNG based)-Gets addicted to said game-Gets real invested in making currently meme decks (not META)-Gets salty everytime loses in a match against Cancer Meta decks whilst using Meme deck-Loses everytime (with the occasion of lucky wins with MEME)-Quits and stops playing for awhile-Hears a new expansion coming out with new leaders-Gets invested and interested and started playing again-Repeat from 410/10 would play and contend against a meta deck using anime-waifu foe (where's the husbandos?) using meme decks  again
"While I enjoy the art and the story. this was a very frustrating game for me. In story mode, the computer AI, plays the same cards over and over again with the exact sequence of moves. Meanwhile my class has the basic cards, and they are mixed up too well each time. I tried adjusting my deck over and over again to play against the same AI class, with no luck. They really need to make the story play easier. Yes, the first two rounds are freaking easy, then the AI suddenly changes into god mode and wipes me out quickly. Also, when I play PVP (Not ranked) the computer puts me up against players who have many more advanced cards than I do, and special decks that are in the store. They are very hard to compete against, when a new player only has the basic cards. I have played several other CCG games, but at least I did win about 30-40 percent of the time. So I'm no newb to these games. At least HS computer matches people up well with similar level cards. In Shadowverse it's a slaughter! Definitely a Play to Win game!  :-("
"The RNG in this game is over the top. I'm playing to see if it gets any better, but I really don't believe it will. You spend the entire match making a strong card and then enemy plays a card that counters everything you have done that match. This isn't a rare occurance either. EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. There is also a card that does 1/2 your hp (Can kill you in 2 turns). this card LITERALLY cannot be destroyed. It can't take damage. So if your enemy has anything above 5hp, its gg, dosn't matter how good your hand is. You lose.UPDATE: Just found out there is a card that has a passive: ""Win the Match"". Really...?"
"Seems alright after a quick test.The menus are poorly designed though and it takes a while to really know how to do anything. Everything is unnecessarily clunky and messy which is common in these types of games.Also you can change the voice overs from the horrible english dubs to the jap ones with a bit of fiddling around.One other really bizarre thing is that you have to play through the tutorial before you can manage any settings like resolution and framerate limit. Just blows my ♥♥♥♥ing mind. But I guess that is to be expected from a mobile game.I don't see myself loving this, but its a good alternative for hearthstone. Playing a bit here and there."
This game is great.I love the variety of character. It's easy to get into and worth playing to pass time. It's the best online card game in the market for fTp players.(I think they blow harethstone art out of the water)
"Just started and I honestly have no idea how I can possibly progress in this game.  I've played dozens of ranked games and lost every single one.  All of my missions to get gold require wins in ranked mode which is something I can't do with the cards I have.  Maybe I'm just terrible but I do just fine in both Hearthstone and Eternal.  They did give me 40 packs when I started but I haven't been able to build any kind of coherent deck with those.  I can't recommend this game if you're f2p.  That would change if the devs changed the missions to ""play 20 swordcraft cards"" or something actually doable so I could actually progress."
"Too many overpowered cards that has no limit and are played 3 of in every rank games. Rank is pay to win. Arena is filled with god level players in grandmasters and are match up with new rookie players. Story mode is fine, good story and art."
"How about you sell the leader cards- no, just the leader, after their expansion is rotated out?Because I'm not tired of opening Chronos for like 3 seasons to find Ceberus AT ALL.Other than that... good card game. With weebs art ofc. And they actually do something to balance it. Not really a good job but still.If you have some experience with other Cygames stuffs like GbF or RoB then you might wanna try this out since it has those games' character. Other than that reason... I don't really know.Pretty decent game to me."
"I don't really have anything to say about the game. It's pretty fun.So instead here's a chocolate fudge recipe.-2 cups of sugar-half a cup of cocoa-1 cup of milk-4 tablespoons butter-(not required) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract1) Grease an 8x8 inch square baking pan. Set aside.2)Combine sugar, cocoa and milk in a medium saucepan. Stir to blend, then bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer. Do not stir again.3)Place candy thermometer in pan and cook until temperature reaches 114CÂ°. If you are not using a thermometer, then cook until a drop of this mixture in a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. Feel the ball with your fingers to make sure it is the right consistency. It should flatten when pressed between your fingers.4)Remove from heat. Add butter or margarine and vanilla extract. Beat with a wooden spoon until the fudge loses its sheen. Do not under beat.5)Pour into prepared pan and let cool. Cut into about 60 squares.just let it bake while you're playing"

The game is fine except that you have to play against neutral ♥♥♥♥ing bloodcraft in every ♥♥♥♥ing game. I understand about meta gaming and ♥♥♥♥♥ since I came from Hearthstone and even Pokemon tcg but this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Still recommending this game in hope of better balancing in the future.

"UPDATED: Are you looking for a fun, reasonably balanced card game? Then stay the hell away from this one. Go play Hearthstone, Faeria, Eternal, literally anything else. The developers are absolutely, completely clueless when it comes to balancing cards, taking the ""nuclear arms race"" approach: if they want to boost an archetype they buff it to high heavens, releasing flat out broken cards until it becomes an absolutely dominating force. In the same vein, if they decide a deck overperforms they don't dial it back a notch - no sir, they nuke it out of existence.Right now - without any exaggeration - if you queue up for a game in higher ranks 80% of your matches will be one of two decks. Eighty. ♥♥♥♥ing. Percent. For crying out loud, you can take a single Hearthstone class and it will have more competitive deck diversity than all eight classes in this game combined. Those decks are so head and shoulders above everything else that game simply doesn't have mid-tier decks anymore. The power gap between top dogs and the next best thing is that big that everything else feels like tier 4 in comparison.If you value your free time, run like it's plagued. Go play an actually decent game. And God forbid spending any money on this; from thr top of my head I can think of at least 20 better ways to spend your hard earned dough than this game. Including setting the bills on fire."
"Weeb Hearthstone (Published as ""Shadowverse"") is a pretty good game.For people who like CCG's, you have some solid gameplay and a good variety in decks (30 shadows are hard)For weebs, you have anime card artFor lonley people, you have a bunch of cards that are maidsIn all seriousness, this♥♥♥♥♥♥is really good."
"From a beginner standpoint, this game is trying very hard to be quite impenetrable. Someone recommended this game to me after I got bored of Eternal, which, if nothing else, is a very cleanly designed CCG, but this game is a mess.First impressions weren't great. I couldn't reach a menu to adjust volumes or play the game in fullscreen without finishing the tutorial. That's... real lazy. Once I did get into the actual game, a lot of other visual gripes started showing up. For example, I found it difficult to tell what faction some cards were without mousing over them, because the only indication seems to be a tiny dull icon at the bottom of a card. The cards look basically identical. The text is oversized, and yet information about what a card actually does is still hidden behind a mouseover menu. Heck, the UI is such a shameless port that they even left in the little sparkly effect over the mouse cursor whenever you click somewhere.The art is all pretty good, but the art style is all over the place. It's like they didn't have a style guide, and instead just commissioned half of deviantart to do hot chicks and called it a day. It seems to range all the way from chibi style to generic digital art to hyper-detailed fantasy pinups, and its real jarring.I also had a lot of trouble just trying to learn the game, as the pacing seemed really off. I finished the first story campaign, which ends in a completely unfair fight where you just have to wait until the AI gets a bad draw. Learning to play is also challenging due to the speed of enemy turns and no clear visual cue about what actually is happening. Again, having text on cards, or at least taking a second to linger on effects, would help a lot.Overall this game is just not very friendly to new players. Call me a noob if you will, but if a game cannot draw new players, it doesn't have much of a chance at growing, and right now this game is a horrible experience for new players.There are some things to like about this game. I like that each card can be evolved, and has different art (sometimes its just a cheap recolor or mirror though). Voiced cards are cool, and the game seems rather generous with packs, giving you quite a stack to start out with. After that it seemed a lot worse though, and the packs I opened seemed rarely to have anything worthwhile in them.Unfortunately for me, if all the game has is a few solid mechanics, but actually playing it is a chore thanks to poor design choices, then I am not having a good time."
"Has great potential and is highly aesthetically appealing, both visually & auditorily.  However, it's racked with severe game imbalances.  Not just between the classes, but in the game's very mechanics themselves.  This coupled with several specific uninteractive strategies & a lack of basic sportsmanship(a common trend with online games in general) ruins a lot of the game's enjoyment.It's not any worse than Hearthstone(aka ""Shamanstone""), so if you like the aesthetic nature & can tolerate consistent disrespect from other players, in other words if you're a casual, then you'll probably like this game.  For real gamers, you'll only find enjoyment for however long you're able to put up with unsportsmanlike conduct."
"Pros:-Very F2P friendly for starting out players, can build viable decks within first day of play.-The recent addition of 'Solo missions' (completing daily quests for pack currency) make it easier for players with limited collections to acquire gold over time.- More value per pack on average due to opening 8 cards at a time rather than the typical 5.- Wide variety of deck types and interesting card effects.Cons:- Rewards system tied to Ranked ladder leads to tedious grinding should you want to play for extended periods of time.- Overall cost of decks is increasing due to recent adoption of introducing 2 legendaries per craft/faction with each new expansion.- Cygames' balancing philosophy, in that they refuse to directly address blatantly problematic legendary cards. This has been demonstrated in the two most recent expansions.A few months ago, I would recc. Shadowverse on the spot. However, the truth of the matter is the state of the game currently is extremely poor in higher tiers of play, encouraged by some very questionable card design on Cygames' part and an unwillingness to act quickly to resolve obvious issues. For casual play Shadowverse is still quite fun, the artstyle appealing if anime/waifus is your thing and very generous on the F2P side of things. If you're intending to invest proper time and/or money into it, though, I would highly suggest taking into consideration other available CCGs at the moment before making the commitment."
"Cancerous... but Vania (Daughter) is in the game. Also, nice arts for the cards.8/10EDIT: It has nice collaborations, such as Fate Stay/Night Heaven's Feel with leader skins.. Rin <3"
"A fantastic CCG with so many possible deck archetypes that play wildly different to each other, a very generous business model that lets you increase your collection at a steady pace and unique mechanics that distinguish it from other card games out there. Also RNG is kept to a minimum unlike some other RNGfests :P I rate it 8/8."
"You can't change settings properly during the tutorial.Interface is mildly annoying, difficult to see card details.Tutorial is for total casuals, doesn't stop annoying you even after starting the Solo campaign.Music gets extremely annoying very early.Can't do settings during battle.AI turn and animations take way too long.Actions are restricted even in campaign mode. Leave me alone tutorial.Voice actors are just as annoying as the giant boobs of the characters."
"Although balance atm isn't very good, the developers are rolling out a patch this week. This is a response time of about a month. Compare this to hearthstone where metas could be established for up to 6 months. I greatly appreciate the amount of effort that goes into this game."
"Very good game, the core gameplay is quite similar to Hearthstone but with less RNG, new player experience is pretty good since you get lots of free packs and gold in the start of the game, the game graphic and cards ruling are a lot better than the buggy Hearthstone. Will recommend this to anyone who got bored of Jade Druid ( although its getting nerfed ) and RNG to play this game."
"Shadowverse CCG is one of the best in my opinion card games out there. With great enjoyable full voice acting and an intresting story to follow in solo mode for your characters. But then there is also the multiplayer ranking which is an absolutly great idea plus another game mode to mention is Arena where you constantly choose 2 cards out of 4 until you get your 30 card deck. This game is extremly well made with beautiful designs to main characters, the moving picture cards and proffesional anime cut scence. But also got to mention the card opening is so addictive and entertaining. You always never know what you will get. And trust me Shadowverse CCG is really generous. On my 2nd go or something i opened the pack and got a legendary. Its well recommended to all CCG lovers. But also i recommend this game for any one else. Am not an CCG fan but this game hooked me."
"First impression is very good of the game since it will give you a lot of packs for free. The mechanics feel intresting, every card feels unique and the beautiful artwork.However this impression quicly changes when you play against other players or get to some oponents in the story. you'll see that there are many cards that can single handedly remove any chance of you winning, even with perfect play. If you plan on playing this game be ready to deeply reach into your pockets to create decks that have any chance of winning. And from what I read in other reviews, ranked seems like a joke. only a handfull of decks being played in there, even at low ranks."
"They fixed their♥♥♥♥♥♥ stop crying people.THey just made a mistake, like everybody does. This game is great again, and I wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone interested in card games. "
"Shadowverse is an online collectable card game available on Steam, iOS and Android.The game follows a number of characters as they go about pursuing various objectives, from a woman trying to resurrect her dead fiance to a young girl just going on an adventure for the first time and attempting murder as she does. The idea of having a variety of characters all pursuing different goals and encountering each other as they do so is certainly an interesting one, but none of them feel terribly interesting or unique to me. The whole game has this problem, to a certain extent - it all feels simply like a generic fantasy world without any real distinguishing features. Additionally, there is very little context for what the different cards represent in the game world, assuming they represent anything, and for how the card battling represents conflict in the game.On the gameplay side, things aren’t a whole lot better. The game is very similar to Hearthstone in its play, the biggest difference I’ve seen so far being the card evolution mechanic, which allows you to power up two or three creatures, depending on whether you went first or last, after a certain number of turns has passed. While I can’t say I’ve seen that specific mechanic before, it alone isn’t enough to make the game feel unique.One thing I can praise, however, is the art design. The cards, the characters, and even the backgrounds are quite detailed and nice to look at. The voice acting is also much better than I expected from a free-to-play card game, though that isn’t saying a whole lot. The music is also pretty good, though not exceptional.Pros:There is a wide variety of playable characters, each with different mechanics, storylines, and personalities.It is interesting to see how different characters’ storylines intersect and to see those interactions from both sides.The art design is overall pretty good.The voice acting and music is also pretty good.Cons:The gameplay borrows very heavily from Hearthstone without adding much other than the card evolution mechanic.The setting feels generic, without any unique touches or twists.Little context for what, if anything, the cards represent in-universe.TL;DRA competent card game, though one that doesn’t stand out as anything special. All in all, I would suggest that more effort be paid to giving the game a more unique feel and mechanics."
"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1249926270The fact they censored a leader with only a 0.03% droprate says a lot about Cygames.The censorship is not even consistent since the card version is untouched.And the anniversary leaders are STILL locked behind a 0.03% paywall despite being an hugely unpopular but only way to get them.I can deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥, boring meta.I can deal with rigged legendary/gold cards droprate.I can even deal with extreme grinding.But censoring my waifu?This is where I draw the line.F**K YOU TOO CYGAMES"
"ShadowverseA game about collecting WAIFUOver 400+ waifus with kawaii voice and cg ready to collectOtakus must play!! It's free,and don't fap just because the voice actress has a kawaii voice "
"Shadowverse is a solid CCG with a very generous F2P model behind it. It's easy to gain enough free packs to build a decent deck and start playing right away. There's a story and a practice mode, as well as competitive and arena modes. The ""cutesy"" anime aesthetic of the game may certainly turn-off some, but the amount of content and core gameplay here is definitely worth giving it a shot.The meta can, at times, be stale or a little busted, but the devs are responsive for the most part and keep the game fresh with new cards and balance patches."
"-This game is so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but people on internet says that ""Oh this game is more skill oriented because theres not so much RNG in the game and card"". so whats the problem with some RNG, ie ""deal x damage to random enemy"" or something else.Ya maybe you ever lost because of that, but is it balance? yes of course! Even the basic of TCG ""Draw card"" is a absolute random its the mechanic of the Hearth stone game and make give each player a chance based on that randomness.We ever lose because the draw is so bad and enemy have a good draw, its ok then, its natural.-In Shadowverse, the max amount of same card is 3 and 40 card in deck, and guess what, it seems all people stack 3 of same card method because only plenty of card is reasonable to pick. So the point of ""Shadowverse is Cheaper game"" is also not right, The card you wanted to play is only so few, the rest is garbage.Hearthstone is more balanced in overall class and card properties, not like crap Shadowverse with the overpowered Class and people can mowed down other non ""good"" class pretty easily, because the bad class(runecraft) is useless and cannot compete to the OP class(shadowcraft, dragoncraft) .-First game experience is so unpleasing.My unranked multi match, Compare it to Hearth stone, my Win rate is like about 80%, and guess what about Shadowverse? 0%. Because the Matchmaking is clearly so dumb, it clearly match me with player with plenty time on this kinda game. Myself is a newcomer (maybe 10 game multi of Hearthstone, 6 game Shadowverse)-The battle or the detail of move is so fast and its frustrating to newcomer to know whats really going on.The voice acting is rather useless because it so repetitive, noone care about that by the way. The solo story mode....... ain't nobody got time for listen and read the story. the game control is not polished so well, i ever put some card that i have drag and intended to not to use, but it set it on battle anyway.-The game base is really unforgiving for newcomer, 20 heallth, 40 max card with 3 stack same card, sure new people cannot get 3 stack of card they wanted and figure out 40 card the game meta use because they will match you with old player anyway.Maybe the meta right now to build ""draw card"" abillity, so in 10Crystal phase, we can set so much cheap cost effective card, because not so much card can deal with multipe card."
Love this game so much! Whenever I win it feels like a win whenever I lose it feels like a loss! I've reached Legend in Hearthstone numerous times and its always a quest of Salt and BS. Skill and decisions dont feel as impactful as they do in Shadowverse! When I watch most of my recordings for Hearthstone to see what i could've done differently there would literally have been nothing different in over 63% of my games! Just lose to sheer randomness from silly mechanics like Primordial Glyph for example! When I played Shadowverse and watch my recordings I can see clear as daylight how i misplayed and RNG isn't even near as bad as Hearthstone. If you want a good card game i definitely would give you this over RNGstone!
"I liked Shadowverse a lot when I first started playing it, but as I got further up the rankings I started to see how unbalanced the game is. In fact, it's probably the most unbalanced card game I've ever played.It has the same problems that Heartstone has and that's that it's too limited by being a mobile game. Can't disrupt your opponent's plays during their turn.Can't disrupt your opponent's hand/discard pileNot enough cards that allow you to manually search for cards in your deck so you have to rely on RNGCombine this with the insanely oppressive aggro meta decks that Shadowverse is plagued with and you end up with a lot of games where one player gets steamrolled just because they went second or couldnt set up a decent board early on.This game badly needs some type of defense mechanic if it's not your turn. Something similar to ""hand trap"" cards in Yu-Gi-Oh because there is a lot of times where there is nothing you can do if your opponent gets ahead of you. Sometimes as early as the first turn if you get a bad hand. If you dont mind the aggro playstyles, the simplicity, and having to spent alot of money to stay competitive then go for it.At least it has really nice artwork."
"<Final Edit>Pay 2 Win, utter trash. The game is beyond redemption don't touch with a 40 foot barge pole.------------------A good solid  traditional cardconcept ruined by rush gameplay & pay to win.The game is free to play but pay to win, standard format. You purchase cards using in game rewards in addition to real life cash. Of course the in game rewards are not enougth to make a winning deck of cards.There is a face (you) which has 20 HP, you play cards which either defend your face or attack opponent face. Solid concept but skewed badly in Shadow Verse. Games are too quick, the only valid strategy currently is rush face with anyother card being a dud draw to yourself.The winning strategy of the game is to fill your deck with as many ''Storm cards'' which can damage face on play bypassing other defensive cards. This fact means that with fully optimised decks shadow verse is just a crapshoot without strategy. You can only fill so much of your deck with storm cards (they keep issuing more however) so then you have non storm cards a.k.a duds. It's pure luck if you draw storm before an opponent, very few games will reach conclusion. By buying cards for IRL cash you can plug holes with new storm cards removing duds. The more you pay the less duds you get. You then coinflip in a game hoping not to pull a dud card against an opponent.There is no defence against ''storm'' apart from ''ward'' which is easily by passed with support cards or face heal which does not have the 'N' required to oppose an opponents storm.In short a well presented & flashy non skill based game, empty without engange strategy but a nice time waste for a few hours. Graphics are cool & sounds are well voiced."
"This ""Hearthstone"" copy features a interesting, yet hard story mode and some excellent voice acting.The story kept me busy for ~25 hours, which is surprisingly long for a Trading Card Game.Step by step you learn the motives and backstory of the main characters and classes you can play and ultimately you fight against an AI that shows you how to really play the deck of the class.But that's all there is. The PvP section of the game is filled with imba decks that will wipe out beginners within a few turns. Gamebreaking cards that destroy all of your units in a single swipe or just like that make every enemy unit evolve at once (which gives them a huge bonus) are enough to make everyone who isn't pay-to-win want to quit.Because there are only 2 (free) ways to progress in this game. Either by gathering the low rewarding daily login bonus for the end of time until you can afford some decent decks with the ingame currency or playing pvp and get beaten in 6 out of 10 games because the game can't put you against equal players. From the remaining 4 games 2 will be players who quit right away or just do nothing to stall time (for whatever reason) and then quit. The last 2 of 10 are games that you might actually win. Totally worth it.It's mainly because of the great story mode that I recommend this game."
"Gameplay has many similarities to Hearthstone, but that's when learning the basics. Each class as you can expect has their own mechanics, but even with (right now) three expansions there's good versatility to create all kinds of Decks. Sure that there's the fear of facing the meta/tier decks on higher ranks, but its card pool allows creativity enough to make many things work together. Finally there's its unique feature called Evolution, a limited resource that can turn arround games or give you an immediate answer against opponent actions. This mechanic is what makes the game stand out compared to others, as managing its use is the main learning curve of the game.The game also gives a big welcome to new players with several rewards on the go, and along a very friendly card pull ratio soon enough you can build a solid deck in a pair of days. And even if you are in bad luck is not difficult to make low budget decks with the cards available. However keep on mind that some classes are harder to learn than others, being the main challenge to learn the game (Like Swordcraft is newbie friendly by summoning and boosting small monsters, while Havencraft requires stalling and shortcuts for their cards to start working). There's also Take Two (Arena or Draft format), which by default gives you a pack by trying and other bonuses the more wins you get, and you can get tickets for free by simply playing Ranked.With all sorts of ways to earn packs with high pull ratio, a diverse card pool allowing many strategies to work regardless of budget, and many game modes to tutorial newcomers through all its mechanics, is a solid card game which sets you ready to face other newcomers and experts after a few hours learning. Just keep on mind that the game is quite aggro encouraging with its Evolution mechanic along certain effects, so might give you a negative experience if you don't learn the matchups. Overall, a solid game for anybody who wants to try a card game but don't wanna wallet through to make a decent Deck, as well those who got tired of other card games and wanna start with a solid build immediately."
"So I only played it for almost 4 hours. It is a decent CCG and I would recommend it to others since it is good.But... just like in Hearthstone, I hate to not be able to declare blockers myself or being attacked directly because you need creatures with ward, like in HS. Besides that its good. Short on PvE Content but you get tons of cards to get started with so you may can access PvP more or less easily."
"This is a boring game because most players are use Tempo Runecraft Deck to fight.the deck allow INCORRECT operating hand card  play into bettlefield still let you win opponent easy.it's not to need the game know how,just need some lucky and enjoy the RNG of Daria.Welcome to TempoVerse."
"This is the best CCG I've ever come across. They actually give you tons of free packs to get new players started, and there's a surprising amount of voice-acted singleplayer content.I don't recommend this because the UI is designed for mobile, not for PC. Makes it frickin' awful at times. This is most obvious and obnoxiously annoying with the way your cards in hand jump back and forth from the corner right to in front of your hero when you go to play them. AND THEY KEEP MOVING BACK AND FORTH WHEN YOU PLAY SPELLS, TARGETED EFFECTS, etc. That looks trashy as hell, definitely the worst part of the interface.If they fixed that hideous mess and maybe a better PC client, this game is a recommend hands-down, as long as you aren't squeamish of anime shenanigans (read: squeaky voices and pandering)."
"Don't let negative reviews of this game misinform you.  They just need to learn how to play and accept that they cannot win every game.  There's always a bigger fish, a better player, a luckier draw. The game is generous if you want to be completely free to play.  You win a lot of coins and packs just for logging in and playing (multiple modes, all award free stuff).  They also have a draft format and the better drafter you are, the more you are rewarded.  If you want to spend money, you can get good value with special limited time purchase options and preconstructed decks.  My only pet peeve is that to get full benefits of free stuff, you have to login and play every day.  I really dislike ""daily"" stuff that doesn't give you some sort of catchup buffer.  People have lives and play other games, we can't be logging into every single game every single day."
"Game is almost impossible to play once you start climbing the ranks. Most players already have numourus legendaries in their decks (most of which are broken beyond belief) and the game doesn't even give you the most basic cards to make a decent deck. Most people even lose on purpose to prevent climbing up ranks as once you get to the next bracket you can't go back down even if you are horribly mismatched which is counter intuitive and just dumb. You can forget about unranked mode since that is even worse in terms of ever winning a game. So unless you've been playing since launch, It's very much pay to win.Edit: New expantion made everything worse. So if you are a new player, instead of winning only 10% of the time expect to win only 1% of the time. Doesn't matter the game mode you pick. Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want to get anywhere in the game.Also this is the only card game I've ever seen in which over half the cards in the game are completely worthless from either being too expensive for what they do, too weak, too situational, etc; and I'm not talking about old cards, I mean new cards as well. I'll use bloodcraft as an example. As of the current expantion there are only 2 types of bloodcraft decks: neutral and bats. Every other card in bloodcraft is almost worthless as of the currect expantion if it's not neutral or a bat. Sure you might win a few matches running a different deck, but it doesn't change the fact that the game punishes you for playing bloodcraft as anything that isn't neutral or bats since they are the most efficient cards per cost for that faction."
"Way less RNG, more F2P-friendly than HearthstoneHowever, has an incredibly toxic community due to the mass immgration of Hearthstone players, and for the extensive amount of salt one can get from grindinf ranked in this game. This is also another reason why you see so many nerf/complain threads and negative reviews based on ""cancerous metas"" that were in the past. If you look at Hearthstone and maybe even other CCGs, there are always dominating decks in every meta (Dude paladin and Cubelock in Hearthstone right now for example)Only real complaint of the game so far is the disconnect system, where you sometimes can lose a game due to your opponent rage-disconnecting (which quite a few people do because as I said, the community is saltier than the dead sea), and you have to wait 90 seconds before the game result is decided"
"It's like Hearthstone, except it's good. It's a little difficult if you rank up using a meta deck and then fall behind; I recommend not doing ranked until you have like everything. Some cards can be a little imbalanced (Daria!!!!) but it's never like Dr. Boom levels of OP"
"One of the worst gaming card i  have seen. This game is only about meta, i started and ALL my enemies had meta deck. And you can't do a thing about this, it's just a♥♥♥♥♥♥of newbie. I tried for long and i'll try again, but i'm kind of disgusted by this tryhard Hardcore. (My first ennemie had a tiers 2 deck complète who destroyed my little game). So it's no't a game for playing fun, it's only about tryhard. ):"
"Coming back to this game just to remember why I uninstalled this game. I swear I can only find runecraft player that only use D-shift runecraft deck.. ranked or unranked... Everytime. Draw cards and boost spell, maybe a card to defend itself until 8~10 playorbs then use gaint chimera just to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. If you're using a late game deck, you're basically screwed. I hope devs just create a 1 playorb card that deals 20dmg and let RNG decide everyones win and lose. I still remember I don't even get to play for 3 rounds straight just because someone wanna find his/her End Game Card. Why were there  skip cards when draw cards already exist? What am I playing? UNO? What next? -4 cards instead of +4 where you send four of your opponent's cards on hand to graveyard?"
"Highly recommended if you have ever played and liked either Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering. As a friend of mine put it, this game is essentially magic packed inside of a hearthstone shell.From my own experience, this game is the polar opposite of what can often feel a long and brutal F2P grind contained in Hearthstone. You get an INSANE amount of starting cards and you can very quickly earn a large amount of starting gold and arena runs to get you going.There is literally no reason to not try this game if you are mildly interested in CCGs. The competitive scene is funded and active."
"This is THE most F2P/newbie generous TCG as of 2017. Faeria used to so until they dropped their buy all the cards for a cheap low price.Now lets get this clear, TCGs in general is not a game best experienced from a F2P position. You just cannot keep up with those who would pay for crystals to get the Shadowverse daily deal for card pack.And then what happens is that you are restricted in the number of deck types you can field. And then those who are in this position will go around grumbling about this and that card/s, deck/s that they don't have being overpowered.As for aggro, Shadowverse is quite ""anti aggro"". Instead Shadowverse is orientated towards combo decks and wins are accomplished by steady reduction of hitpoints OR a surprise burst of damage. If you don't like combo generated burst of damage, DON'T start playing Shadowverse where you have only 20 health points and when a combo kicks in, it usually though not necessarily means game over. Its a east vs west culture thing.Games are thus designed by intention to be short, anything above turn 10 is pretty epic and both are probably playing control. As for going for face, aggro decks well lets put it this way, you drop 2 or 3 warded minions before turn 4 and typically, aggro Sword or aggo Bat will concede. And there is ample early board clear available. You want to see aggro being supreme, play Faeria as Yellow. You don't even need to harvest mana from the well. Play a go for face, face is the place type of deck, prepare to be conceding a lot of times.I used to harvest on ladder/rank the much gripped about Blood Spawn deck (pre nerf) until they nerfed it and my cheese got moved. Now I harvest aggo. :) If you cannot find the gap in the meta, well, go reddit and call for nerfs and say you want to go back to Hearthstone. I dropped Hearthstone because I found that in Shadowverse, it is much cheaper to maintain my status and infinitely more fun. When I get combo-ed/meme, it actually brings a smile on face while swearing... and I promptly go about trying to recreate that deck if it is new to me.I strongly suggest that if you are going to play Shadowverse, you be prepared to buy a 1200 crystal set each month. USD29.98. This 1200 crystal will allow you to buy 24 packs over a month using the daily offer. Then save the gold you get  from daily task, enough to buy a pack typically, for buying packs from the quarter expansion. Yes there is a new expansion set every 3 months. The extra cards you can from the daily deal, you liquify for vials (crafting resource) and save them for the new expansion. I am typically able to open 150+ new expansion card packs at the start each expansion this way.Using this strategy, you will have more than enough resources to get all the cards each expansion. And right now there is offer to for newbies to get 7500 crystals are a discounted price and you can get the discounted price for up to 3 purchases.Also note that Shadowverse ladder system is newbie friendly. Its operates on a leagues model. There 5 ranks/leagues before Master rank. You don't lose you rank each month but you can stop yourself from ranking up to a more competitive rank if you don't have a competitive card collection. And at Master rank, you compete to be in the top 10000 players for vials and 10 free card packs each month.Card expansion rotation is expected in 2018 so that should limit the initial financial outlay if you are starting now and decide to be serious about the game. Basic card set and maybe 4 expansions will in play each time. Maybe more than 4. And remember, you don't have to decide so soon, there are tonnes for free packs to get just starting the game and from story mode and you will be insulated from a cut throat competitive because of the league/rank laddering system.I am pretty sure it will be fun assuming you are not going to be F2P, the meta will change each expansion, people will grip about this and that, there will be nerfs, the meta changes again BUT all the while, there will be plenty of opportunities to harvest the ""sheep"" decks by using the correct techs against the sheep decks or by using one that specifically targets it.Your ability to analyze and arrive at a solution against ""sheep"" decks (aka netdecks) will be be rewarded in Shadowverse. Intelligence gets used and gets you the wins."
"Gameplay is great, Artstyle is insufferable1. Make Account2. Get 10 free packs of every set and a bunch of arena tokens3. Disenchant everything4. Make a metadeck of your choice and have material leftover5.Make new Account"
"Game had a very rough 2017 up to this point with really poorly designed sets released that powercreeped everything and completely ruined the game with sheer power of going first. But things are looking better now after the previous set, WD, was almost completely nerfed and the developer set a new direction for the future. This latest set is alright but there are still few remaining outragous mechanics in the game that are not nerfed yet and make the game less fun than it can be and favor going first by a lot. Notably storm mechanic in sword class, they printed even more storm followers this set so that if the player playing this aggro sword deck and go first, they are highly favored to beat anything in 5 turns without much the opponent can do but while going second the deck is not that good. This variance makes the game feel coin flippy and frustrating knowing that you probably lost as soon as the match starts.The other long running problem is Dshift rune decks that used to be slow so it was acceptable but they are far too fast now and beat anything except the most aggressive decks no mattter what in 8 turns so much that not only control but midrange decks now lose to it. I feel it's time to finally nerf that card  too or add some counterplay to it such as discarding hand or increasing the cost of cards in your opponent's hand. SImilarly dshift deck going first means that they can answer any follower with their numbers of removals that reduce the cost of dshift and result in your loss. While going second they will often take damage before they can remove the threats.If they address these two concerns in the upcoming monthly balance changes I feel the game is in a good spot and right now it's mostly balanced with many decks viable."
"Game started decent with an nice tutorial and Solo-/Storymissions.Shadowverse is a Mobile App transported to Steam and has a also a decent production value. The Arenas are 3D Animated which kind off has a low resolution (because it is made for Smartphones) but every Arena has an nice introduction and its own distinguishable soundtracks.At first I thought nice little card game. But at a second look it is basically an Hearthstone clone to the core. And Hearthstone is in my personal opinion not a good card game and Shadowverse is worse because it kinda trivialize its own mechanics.Each class has also in Shadowverse it's own little mechanic but only for it's specific cardset for anything else it has ""Evolution"" which basically grants an Unit under your controll an stat boost and sometimes some special effects.And that's it.I am currently stuck at the end of the Rowen Campaign where i play against a copy of my own deck and i can't beat it. I personally think the reason is not because unlucky play or pure incompetence but because the AI seems to know what i have on my hand has always the perfect card set to counter it.So i am currently under the impression the AI is cheating to win the game. Which feels kinda disheartening. Especially if as i tried to counter this effect by let the AI run out of cards only for the moment that the AI plays a couple of cards to replenish its hand.At this point I would have re-arranged my Deck to prove my thesis further and to get an advantage, especially as the Storymission told me that I won a few cards for the specific class and should add it to the deck but there is no option to do it. Which mean i am stuck with a Deck which can't defeat the AI.I personally will try it again. But at the current state the game consists out of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥Hearthstone consists off: Bash cards around until someone run out of cards or you have an opening and kill your opponent, which is not a very tactical game in my opinion and is way faster over than hearthstone because of the Evolution mechanic which buffs the Units and the fact you have only 20 Hitpoints.Another plus i give the game are the rewards. As a fresh starter i got a bunch of free card packs, tickets, vials (which is basically the magic dust from hearthstone) and a ton of gold."
"The tutorial, not to mention the huge icons, flashing letters, arrows etc make you feel like a super idiot. The RNG system for the cards draw maybe rigged. There is a very high chance that you draw the same card over and over again. Watch the 2018 finals video and you see the same, its almost as if they gave specific cards to the player.Key gameplay points - only specific monsters with 'Ward' ability can block. You can evolve monsters for evolution points which increase stats by +2/+2 and give it the ability to attack monsters (not player) immediately. If you start first you get 2 evolution points, if you start second you get 3 evolution points.Gameplay seems to be killing monsters on board as fast as you can, so basically your monsters genuinely wouldnt survive past a single turn, but if they do you have a good lead. You will die very very fast if opponent monsters remain on board. But there are a good variety of specialities and ways to kill, defend etc and some very powerful(OP) cards around.The size of the game files you have to download is about 4-5GB give or take. The inital client download is only about 500MB which is small and fast, but then you have to download many many GBs of actual game files, I dont remember. The update for new release cards and content is about 4GB.This feels pretty big given what the game is.The game has pretty cartoonish graphics and animations but they take too long so I just turn animations off. Overall its good fun, but it is very important that you dont get into the mentality of blaming balance. Its very easy to and I do it all the time, sometimes its just really frustrating and I cant help it been so weak...""xxx is so OP and my cards so so weak @#(*$&(@^!"". But what you should be doing is trying to find cards and build decks that can stand up to those OP stuff. However, it can take a very long time to get the powerful cards. They should really fasttrack the progression.The game takes alot of time and money if you want to build powerful decks - from powerful cards. If you want to have fun, you have to concentrate on finding the right card combos and not relying on your likes and dislikes as balance is terrible."
"The game is somewwhat censored.You will have to replace the images yourself for the original experience but they have not officially given the option to play originally or censored.I dont support such practices. Thread with care.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM3xOWFVpQcFuture of the game as they keep moving forward. If you are alright supporting, paying and paving way to keep going as it is, then more power to you.I dont feel ok with supporting or paying for such practices."
I used to love playing this game when there were different variations on decks now its just the same 2 or 3 decks you play against which makes the game boring and stale. Every expansion seems to make the game worse and the game to me is straight up unenjoyable these days.
"I love card games. I tried this one out because it has great graphics (no, I'm not talking about the anime girls...) but it just felt...boring. It didn't feel great to play or super strategic. Not to mention after 7.4 hours I just couldn't find a faction that i thought was fun or that I wanted to bother playing.on the positive, it gave me a large amount of free packs and seems to be a lot of fun for other people. Oh yeah, and it is free so there's no reason to not really give it a whirl. Wish i could vote, neutral to be quite honest."
Faster and exciting gameplay compared to its rival Hearthstone.Very generous gifts and rewards.Can go f2p easily and compete on ladder without getting stomped. WAIFUSCons:My ding-dong gets hard while playing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Nice Art!But in the end the game is purely based on luck, so disapointing.It's NOT a p2w though, that's positive.If you don't mind your games outcome being decided by pure RNG, then you'll love it :) "
"Gave it a shot. If you care about competitive skill in a card game, this isn't for you.It's horribly unbalanced, offering very little strategic depth and counterplay.Rarity is tied directly to power, which in a card game is a ridiculous concept to implement if you cared at all about competitive integrity. Instead it points to a money grab philosophy, much like hearthstone. At first this game seems like it could be fun, but after some time you realize it feels very much like a cheap play to win mobile phone game. Don't bother. "
This game was fun at first but the new chapters to the characters is just unfair. Giving more than 3 op cards to your oponent is making it close to impossible to progress. I understand it's to make the game chanllenging but this is becomming to challenging.
"I started playing Hearthstone earlier this year and instantly got addicted to it, however by the time Un'Goro released and That One Quest Card (you know the one I'm talking about) happened, I started getting really frustrated. That's when I heard about Shadowverse. Before long I found myself not even logging into Hearthstone anymore; it was clear Cygames had done Blizzard's own game better than Blizzard. Plus I don't know anything about Warcraft and I love Shadowverse's high quality anime style artwork, so the game was just more appealing to me on an aesthetic level too.Now having played for several months and clocked in 112+ hours as of this writing on Steam alone (I certainly have more on my tablet and phone), I can definitely say everyone declaring that this game is now garbage are blowing things way, WAY out of proportion. Yes, Wonderland Dreams was a terrible expansion, but only because for some reason a large amount of players think Spawn of the Abyss Bloodcraft and Alice Neutralcraft are the only viable decks anymore when they're anything but. I mainly run Death's Ledger/Nepthys Shadowcraft (my own build too, I don't netdeck) and I can usually beat these decks without too much issue, especially Spawn Bloodcraft which I see lots of people complaining about. Like, seriously? You're gonna whine about Spawn when freaking Heavenly Aegis exists? Trust me, it's nowhere near as bad as everyone is saying. Ignoring the unoriginality and salt from certain people, this game is still fantastic and much, MUCH better than Hearthstone in just about every way. Such as....-You get around 40 free packs just for making an account-There's 3 daily missions for rewards every 21 hours-8 cards per pack-An actual story mode, fully voiced too!-Lots of free packs/gold/other goodies; Cygames are possibly the most generous developers of a free-to-play game ever. Of course the game does indeed have flaws, some of which are....-In later stages of the story mode the AI will use impossible deck combinations (using cards from multiple classes that are exclusive to each class), which is not only obnoxious but pointless in preparing you for PvP since you'll never have to fight those decks/strategies when up against other actual players.-Take Two (Arena mode) is kind of a gamble because it relies so heavily on the RNG of what cards you can pick from. Sometimes you'll get cards that have really good synergy and other times you'll just get trash. I'd say only give it a try once you're pretty experienced with the game and have saved up a bunch of tickets; NEVER waste gold on this mode.-I feel like the exchange rate when melting down a legendary card should be 1500 vials as opposed to 1000, and crafting a legendary should cost 3000 instead of 3500. That way you could essentially be able trade 2 unwanted legendaries for 1 you do want, which seems like it would be more fair.-HEAVENLY AEGIS WAS A MISTAKE. Seriously Cygames what were you thinking with this BS??But I'd still give this game a solid 8/10. ""Hearthstone except anime and a lot better"" is honestly the best way I can sum it up. If you're like me and you love card games but are finding yourself without the money keep up much with physical TCGs anymore (I miss you, Force of Will....) you'll find yourself really into Shadowverse and playing it almost if not every day. Wonderland Dreams might have been a dud but I feel like things will improve again with future expansions, or at least get people to stop playing nothing except the same couple decks that aren't nearly as OP as they think they are."
"This game is a genuinly good times alround. The evolve machinic was admittly one that was hard to get your head around at first considering how simple it seems but mastering it and the large card pool really open up this game. It breaths new life into CGG's and have been having a blast since day one of playing.In other reviews you will often see people moan about balance but A- They haven't seen Hearthstone, and B- They likely have no idea how to play or deck build since almost every day I play a oringal style deck and have good success, even against what most people would consider to be the top class. Play smart. Build smart. Be yourself. Have a good time."
"There's been a sort of card game boom for a couple of years. Streamlining mechanics, having the most impartial judge (the cpu itself)  and making things simpler have been a huge boon to game developers investing in this genre, making it really popular. Shadowverse is one of those games. But Shadowverse's greatest asset has become its biggest problem in that there is no way to truly interact with the other player during his turn. There's no blocking, no instant cards, activated abilities, no trap cards, etc. This has made way to a matchup based gameplay (side decks aren't a thing in SV!) that discourages actual deckbuilding, and where matches are in the end short by design."
"Very nice game, sometimes unbalanced, but it depends on situation. I saw a bot called ""VerseBot"" available over internet - still wasn't able to see any bot while playing - thanks god."
"Sever like♥♥♥♥♥♥ always disconect when the others game's ping always good, even both of me and my opponent disconect, i'm always the one who lost wtf ? Pls fix the sever, many players have problem with this."
"Great game it should be noted no matter what past reviews sayI can understand to some degree that past expansion speed up a game, meaning give neutral aggo cards and some legendary cards almost OP status but that is only on SURFACE until u scrach DEEPERThere are new combos and MANY new tactic options available HIDDEN, some call it meme but are quite powerful !Chech this link first before u go further whine mod:https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/64r9vl/what_are_the_otk_decks_out_there_right_now/?st=j6ehvh8p&sh=31a088bband here u can find ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of best decks from japanese NA and EU qualifiers and tournaments tho i find great decks among user created:https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/And that link only provides slight info of many combos very viable: For example u can have Lord Atomy on turn 2! freaking 8/8 monster on turn 2 so deal with that combo, Demon Commander Laura 3 point card Call of Cocytus gives u 5 point Servant of Darkness 13/13 with STORM attack on turn 9, Midnight Haunt + Deathly Tyrant  storm attack 13/13 or 15/15 evolved gave me so many wins on turn 6 and 7 and they call it meme deck lol, Frozen Mammoth + any 7point card is decent combo also that people rarely use and there are many more combos Joust use your spell removal / low cost wards properly to stop aggro and setup up your own comboAnd for 90% of combos u dont need legendary cards at all !"
"(this wasn't always the case otherwise i wouldn't have so many hours in this, but after multiple♥♥♥♥♥♥expansions this game is hopeless unless you are a casual scrub playing on mobile.)braindead decks have the highest winrate and usage ratiodevs REFUSE to nerf legendary cards even if they are the only problem that exists and will instead nerf some other lower rarity card from the most popular deck that runs said legendary.the powercreep in new expansions is fиcking insane and they come out every 3 months going first right now boosts your winrate by 10% if i remember correctly because of the powercreepDarknes Evolved forever in my heartyes, the game is generous, but it doesn't matter because it's badi would only suggest playing it on the sh\tter but even then your brain might become so numb that you will drop your phone in it while playingDO NOT PLAY CARD GAMES. THEY ALL ARE/WILL BE SH\T AND YOU WILL REGRET SPENDING TIME/MONEY ON THEM. you can copy the text in caps and put it in a review of any ccg ever, and it will be true, 100% guaranteed, no need to credit me."
"Very mechanically similar to Hearthstone, so here's a concise comparison:Pros:-Card art is much higher quality (assuming you like the anime aesthetic)-UI is much more informative. Links let you see any special rule or token associated with a card whenever you want.-Free-to-play is very viable as long as you stick to one or two classesCons:-Severe balance issues. There's decks in this game that make jade druid look tame.-Much more of a money pit as it does not have the ""1 copy of each legendary"" restriction-Fewer community resources as the game has a relatively small presence in the WestCautious recommend."
"#hearthstone for weebos. Seems good, meme worthy, tilt worthy, cancer worthy. Overall good game, good graphic that if play on phone can kill battery but good thing got steam release."
"I dont really believe in game reveiews. If you want to see for yourself whether or not a game is good then try it for yourself, do not trust random nobodies on the internet. However if you want some imput as to whether or not this game is a waste of your time then let me tell you that it is not. Realitively easy to start up and significantly less RNG mechanics than in Hearthstone. This is a Card game and i believe it must be compaired to its competition if this review is to hold any value. If you want to have some fun try it, I did and I enjoyed it for a few hours before getting more into it and going on to play for a while after that."
"Hearthstone, but does everything better... the amount of money needed to be competative... zero, unless you going for a very expensive deck all Animated cards with 9+ Legendaries to terrorify your opponent."
"i enjoy playing this game but I'm gonna give it a negative because atm the meta from my experience so far in my recent games is just rely on one card to win the game (Destruction, Chimera, Anne's Sorcery, Darkfeast Bat) personally I'm not a fan of that♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's literally a card that forces the enemy to forfeit the match (not reliable most of the times you win before they can pull this off but I have faced those who just stall the game and rely on that to win) BUT I MEAN HEY im a silver (C2) Forestcraft one trick in the game maybe I'm just bad. If you combined my phone hours on this game I'd probably have about 50 hours and think thats enough experience for me to have a say. ALSO 40 cards in a deck and 20 hp for face...not a fan of that."
"Shadowcraft-verse. The game where, if you dont play shadowcraft, you will lose alot rofl.On a side note i main swordcraft for ranked play and still have alot of fun. I really enjoy the game for a digital ccg. More so than hearthstone and other competitors. It could use some balancing when it comes to a few choice cards but thats about it. Highly reccomend if CCGS are your cup of tea."
"Pros: The game Looks great and the VA's are fantastic, but thats about it besides being free to play. Oh, not to mention that you really dont have to drop those Legendary Funds for cards when you can create them but that will take some time to get the phials unless you are only playing specfic deck and everything is Meaningless to you. You can always liquify the cards you dont want and create other cards that way. That is another plus. Everything though,is kinda meh in my opinion. Plays Like Hearthstone(then again what doesn't these days lol) but has a ""Unique"" feature which is to evolve your cards in order to gain the upper hand in battle. Cons: Unforutantely, that has its bad side effects that make things seem unfair by having one less evolve crystal than your oppenent if you are going first and if your opponent is running cards that gain shards back as well then you are S.O.L. Its feel like its unfair to those just starting. Also everyones favorite complaint in any TCG is the Pay to Win players. You usually dont see that in beginners so you should be fine if you are just starting out,but you really cant tell to be honest these days.Overall: Give it a shot and see how you feel about it. Don't drop those gloriuous funds unless you plan to be fully invested. You can always delete if it not your cup of tea."
"(+)- no rely on RNG- generous developer- great artwork- (kinda) interesting story(-)- no place for slow deck, everyone (mostly) play aggro deck- changed the Voice Actor for some character (I like the old one)- censorship (because it's a japannese game) "
"Just tried out this game after the Wonderland Dreams card expansion (released on June 28, 2017) and I gotta say, this card game is really beginner friendly, despite all the negative reviews that I read before picking up this game.Yes, there are card packs (and as of this moment pre-built decks are available too, for a really hefty price) that will cater players paying to get the best cards in the game, but every card game that offers in-game purchases or product codes from merchandises will of course put tweaks to make a combination/deck effective potentially, but not exponentially. And how does Shadowverse fare in this pay-to-win issue? Well, I for one thought that buying one would make or give you a powerful card set and decks but in this case, getting such rares will not change the game greatly, because it all plays out with your strategy, Of course, you can't win against a player who bought a 3 pre-built decks or 100 card packs with just a beginner's deck. You've gotta build it, tho it will take longer, but sure enough, you will have a great deck to duke out against those players.And about the gameplay, well, after trying out all the classes and built some deck combinations, Fairycraft and Swordcraft decks fare out quite well with the numbers because their effects and gameplay almost rely heavily on overwhelming the board with lots of followers. As for Runecraft, well, the chances of you getting wrecked by a deck focused on this class is high, if I would concur, as this class bombards the enemies with spells with assorted effects, from drawing cards to outright dealing damage to your followers and leader, and adding to that, their followers get a spellboost every time a spell is used, which in turn makes them stronger or giving them additional effects and that would be very painful to deal with. Decks relying heavily on Dragoncraft cards deal with their enemies with early application of brute force, yes, they seem to have the most powerful low playpoint cost cards in the game, and they have many cards that add playpoint orbs, making it faster to play more powerful cards in within a few turns, and oh did I just forgot to mention that most of their cards get even more powerful as they get more playpoint orbs? That will hurt you really bad. And last but not the least, and my personal favorite among the classes, the Undead Scourge, nah just joking, of course it's none other than the Shadowcraft class. This class' game mechanic and strategy really feels unique to me compared to others, because they rely on shadows (graveyard guys, because it's the undead lol) greatly to increase the potential of most of their cards. Basically speaking, early game, it requires you to sacrifice some followers to add to the shadow count which in turn can be used in a variety of ways and effects, all of which is beneficial to wrecking your opponent. And of course, you can't call them undead if they're not raising any dead right? Annoy your opponents by thinking that he/she annihilated your board, then suddenly a pack of zombies and skeletons just appeared out of nowhere to change the tide of the battle and defeat the Alliance once and for all.Well that's about it, I won't talk about RNGs yet, as I've yet to delve deeper through this game myself, tho I'm reading how to build great decks for starters here and on reddit.TLDR: Try it out, as it is free and basically you've just wasted time if you found it really bad or unsatisfying."
"Seriously. Never ever trust the epic video on the internet and build youself a somehow epic combo. It will never work, It never worked. But still a wonderful game, even if you don't play PvP at all, it's fun to just look at the crads."
"From the amount of negative comments I've read, I'm gonna be one of the many as well. I paid to play this game before the official release, things were alright as there weren't many bots arounds then. After the official release to F2P players, there were constant bot spamming in the main the city area selling in game money for real cash & the server lags badly as well. The developers are constantly shifting the goal post which isn't ethical to players like me who actually paid for the game. The official release was suppose to be somewhere around June but I assume they got greedy and rushed it, which has caused the game to have severe lag issues & bot related issues as well. If you wanna play this game, probably wait for a couple of months and come back, hopefully by then they've fixed the issues."
"4k hours. Okay...This is a review coming from someone since CBT1. Some may just be my opinion or my own personal views so play at your own risk still. Read along if you are interested.At first, actions were actually done very quick, people asked for regional servers (like SA, SEA, EU) and they came in a few weeks after, I was satisfied so I bought a second CBT pack as thanks. I don't really mind spending money as long as it's worth.But things...went a little downhill slowly, it's killing the game. If you check the patch notes, most are actually gacha/TP shop updates. A bug we reported for like a month already was ignored, it wasn't game breaking but it frustrates you so much that an important buff of your class isn't even working correctly.Then there's another incorrect announcement made recently. Literally everything on the event page and mechanics said double exp event or +100% base exp gain. What happened on the actual event? The event requires you to pay a talt(in game item, not expensive, but...) and costs 1 talt more per buff, which becomes very expensive when used repeatedly. Now, that's not the only problem. It only gave 50%, not 100% or double, then a few hours later they said it was 50% as intended. ""As intended"" Good lord, everything on the page said double or 100%, now you say it's 50% as intended. Amazing.When you're having doubts exploits or something, it's actually fine. The game was hacked before and a public command was available for everyone to crash the channel. Great, right? This was already fixed but the fact that we have this happened makes it easy for everyone else to lose trust. Something you can never easily get back.Don't get me wrong, I love the game and I'm already stuck with it since Non-WOW clone MMORPGs are rare now. But if you are looking for a game that won't frustate you in the long run, I don't recommend it at all. Remember, this is from someone who loves the game very much.I had to do a facepalm myself every time I see a AFK/Bot/macro/scripted Necro-Sorc (Necromancer/Sorcerer - a class with summons) go on fields and gain silver with no effort. They're banning them, but very slowly to the point where their backups would be up the moment they get banned. It's stupid and is actually causing inflation, even famous guilds use them now because the risk of being banned is very low.Kinda sad really, this game was supposed to be a gem, but it ended up like this. Improved since CBT? Yes. Recommended? Nope, not until they realize what they are doing. They probably do, but chose to ignore it since they're milking money anyway, which a business does, and it's effective so they're staying with it. Don't expect any changes anytime soon."
"As many have said, the game showed a lot of promise and really pushed some nostalgia buttons for me. However, the paywall is horrendus, UI is clunky, and you can do a whole heck of a lot due to restrictions. Towns are rife with gold spammers and it mucks up an otherwise beautiful looking game. I'd keep on walking on if were you."
"After 7 hours of playing the novelty wore off.Story: LinearQuests: Repetitive (gather this, kill this, collect this) Graphics: Cute and engaging Sound: Needs improvement on the background music department Levelling: Pretty fast but after a while it slows down a little bit (Got up to 30+ in 7 hours)Community: General observation -> Snob. No one really wants to party with newbsOverall: I give this a 7."
"Very annoying to play due to bots or getting kill steal by others.My biggest issue is that job system can be very unforgiving, especially if it is being modified or patched many times which can end up screwing you over in the long run."
"There will inevitably come a time when you will encounter this video game's absolutely atrocious programming, coming across a bug to which you will seek a game master's aid to resolve. Instead of aiding you, they will respond with a typical copy-paste response.(!) My ticket: http://i.imgur.com/nozwuEE.png(!) A thread pertaining others suffering the same issue: https://forum.treeofsavior.com/t/rank-reset-voucher-problem/341924 My name is “Grahil” in that thread.It's a damn shame, because I invested real life currency. I couldn't possibly keep spitting money into a video game that is absolutely handled so poorly, to the extent that a –bug– got rid of critical skill points requiring you to delete your days & perhaps months of character leveling to start over again.It took me 78 hours of game play to get my Cleric to level 100. This, after mountains of character deletions because either you go cookie-cutter character build or you're absolutely screwed against others whom did so.I played Ragnarok Online back in my childhood, I wanted –this– to be the game. To a lot of extent, it is. However, just like International Rangarok Online was, the support is horrific & the development is light years behind korean version.I have a few products in my account, I'm very satisfied with all of them. To the extent that I would actually take the time to submit a review, a bad one at that, really shows just how terrible this video game is handled by the developers.I write this review, in the hopes it gets seen, because I –don't– want you to waste 78 hours of your valuable life. I wanted to keep playing, they decided I was not worth the effort. Well, that's fine & dandy; take another down vote review in a mountain of down vote reviews."
"Copied from my post from forum. Since my holiday thread got deleted and I feel that this is a appropriate thread, here is a daily reminder.Went on a holiday for 2 weeks, avoided any video games for the past 2 weeks or so. Came back to realize nothing has changed. No important updates or non of the bots/macro users banned. http://i.imgur.com/9n68EGe.jpgGM Mango told me she 'MEMORIZED' the list of names I had gave her and will do something about it. Apparently nothing is done. End game is really boring atm. Absolutely nothing to work towards to atm. Also deleting my thread is probably the final blow for me to qui this game.Now I guess I will write a very negative review with my 2586 hours spent in TREE OF SAVIOR.Cya guys probably when Solmiki is out and that will probably be the only content I will do ever again on this game.TL;DR, GAME IS VERY BAD. GM DOESNT CARE ABOUT THE LONGEVITY OF THIS GAME. I SPENT A♥♥♥♥♥♥TON OF TIME GRINDING AND BECAME ONE OF THE STRONGEST, ACTUALLY THE STRONGEST WIZARD IN MY SERVER OR MAYBE ALL SERVERS EXCLUDING THOSE THAT SPEND MONEY BUT GM DOESNT GIVE A ♥♥♥♥ LOL."
Goodbye I can't play this game anymore because tos cannot run under virtual machineI use Windows 10 and Enable Hyper-V because it my jobs. Why i need to disables Hyper-V for your game huh IMC?
Just came back after a long break. Since they added rank reset and new class. Then the stupid class has this long Queue which isn't so bad if it weren't for the fact that the channel kept crashing!! Nice work IMC... I came back and I leaving again. Can't stand stupid ppl keep doing stupid things.
"Would not bother buying the early access. It is unplayably laggy, buggy and all around unenjoyable. Who would have thought not having any region bound servers / less than when other betas were around would cause that to happen.Also you cannot trade with friends unless you buy an expensive (about $20 for 30 trades) token."
"It's worth trying, not worth investing.Cons: - Bugs, old bugs, new bugs, skill lag. - Exploits, bots that goes unpunished. - Ridiculous restrictions which didn't stop RMT. - Horrible FPS- Lack of contents, activities, all you do and all you will ever do is kill stuff. It's just my opinion but a game should have life skills and more social aspect (fishing/farming/ gathering/housing etc...). What guild events currently offer isn't much.- Sh*t load of maps that looks the same and you probably will never return to.- Boring story line.Pros:- Unique art style- Many classes- Combat is funI enjoyed it while it lasts."
"Can't recommend right now, servers are incredibly laggy and un-responsive. At higher levels the number of available channels are reduced, thus ensuring that quests will be over-camped and zones barely playable due to lag/crowding. I would like to play more but right now its nigh unplayable."
To be honest I liked this game but they never fixed the ping the bugs and there's just too many bots I guess leaving things like that unchecked really dampens my mood to play this game.I had a Corsair 2nd class and a Quarel Shooter 3rd class an I was planning to make a Cataphract but I got tired of playing.Even DPS is affected by lag and as a QS and a Corsair thats a big deal. The cash shop isn't even that bad it's just the lag bugs and bots. Well if you have a super fast internet I would recommend you this game and good luck.
"Yes the game currently has issues, As you can tell from all the other reviews. But i think people are judging this game a bit too harsh almost every problem people have is things that can be fixed with time. Claiming that IMC failed is a very quick assumption, i think this game is wonderful and even with its flaws i think when IMC finally adds some more polish and works out the lag issue which is actually the main cause of almost all the problems in the game currently. The game will be a much better place."
"You wont clearly see whats happening in the screen when the aoe skills starts to spam, buggy quests, lots of grinding and its repetitive, not enough people in dungeons, bots (although less compared before) , and lastly some class depends on ping."
CBT player here from 2 years ago. Returned to check out the give aways and am fairly satisfied.I left for 2 years because all the hype I generated from this games release turned into HATE. Hate for the devs. Hate for the toxic community (unaddressed racism hurts the game by disencouraging players to play. BOTTERS. GOLD SELLERS). Hate for the ping. The publishers. ♥♥♥♥ing 3 hours for 10%exp life destroying grinds. What the actual ♥♥♥♥.2 years later and most of these problems have been resolved. Mostly because the games popularity quickly lost momentum which meant less players botters and gold sellers could make money off of.I keep praying this game could still reignite the RO glory days. Maybe it still can.If you dare to play it right now. I heard its harder because no one grinds the lower levels anymore. Mostly because its easier to level up now than it was before.I only there was a decent community manager. And a decent dev team who would listen instead of pushing money making content.Could be better but DONT expect to be.
"Everything so far seems like a broken mess, first we have all these stuff to make you  spend money real fast, second there are so many glitches and bugs that makes this game seem unfinished at best,third  this game lacks prattical funcionalities like boss tracker, and last but not least  this game has two years and looks like kawabamga♥♥♥♥♥♥coming outta my♥♥♥♥♥"
Don't download this... The game name should be Queue of Savior.... all you do is sit in a queue for hours on end waiting to get into a dungeon that takes 5 minutes to complete. If you like sitting there and doing nothing while you wait for 4 other people to join your queue then this is the game for you.
It reminded me of an old Super nintendo game legend of mana for some reasonArt style is niceCouldnt play for long because of the control scheme.Who the ♥♥♥♥ came up with the controlls for this game though.  seriously.
"Kept track of this game before released and thought it would be amazing. Decided to buy a founders back because of how much hope I had for Tree of Savior. Day it releases, there are tons of problems and lag issues that should have been fixed during the testing phases. After a few days pass and they did some updates to ""fix"" the problems, you eventually get to a point where it seems there is a huge difficulty spike that just ♥♥♥♥♥ slaps you across the face. I would not recommend this game to anyone at all since it seems the company taking care of this game just doesn't care about the players at all. Truly feels like a cash grab."
"Fun untill it starts to bottleneck you to the point you need to grind mindlessly to get to the next area. If you like grinding just to walk 4 feet ahead of you, this is the game for you."
"I'm the kind of player who's very patient with games. This game got me excited. An old school, classic MMORPG, with complex builds and multiple classes. The complex builds makes each and everyone in the same class unique in their own way depending on their build, such that everyone who is the same level might not necessarily have the same stats and Damage or Defense (Or Magic Attack or Magic Defense). You could be lv50 and dish out more damage than another person of the same class who is level 60, but lower defense. it's all in the build, and strategizing which path you take in the order of classes.  But after almost 100 hours of playing ToS, it got annoying.. the fact that it's just another developer who wants to profit from the game. Players who bought their VIP passes get almost all the benefits of what a F2P game should be. Whereas all the non cash players struggle a lot just to earn or grind decently. Utterly disappointed with the game. I have never played such a game so biased towards cash spenders. Botters seemed to have flooded in too - but I don't have to talk about that. Enough reviews about botters already. Server's are tolerable to me."
"Product received for freeGold sellers and bots are MORE THAN all monster in every single map. However, you won't  be bored because you will face fantastic LAG and DELAY while playing."
"Buggy, NA Servers down.  Repeatedly switched steam controller configs until something worked (87mins).  Had to run Steam in admin (first time ever) to get stream controller to work. Game tells me illegal characters in name (why let me type them in the first place?)  Game constantly bugs out in Steam Bigt Picture mode.  Finally found working Steam Controller config, attempted to join NA server next day, server is down.  Re-attempt to join NA server, still down.  Lacks polish, NA servers down today?  Maybe bad luck. but who wants to invest time into a game that starts off this buggy?"
"Meh. Pretty much Ragnarok Online, only slightly different. Better controls, grinding, slightly... better graphics, grinding, more annoying community, grinding, no skill point resets (at least not for less than 8$), grinding, and unbalanced classes. Oh, and grinding. Pretty shabby for this day and age, but probably a good grab if you're a weeaboo or broke and looking for a good grind."
"A very nice game and so nice in gameplay and graphics. ruined by the monetization, the huge fear of RMT not allowing to even trade items to friends. And to kill the LA comunity a sucky Datacenter for their LATAM server.Not recomended for south american players as it is right nowfor other areas, enjoy the free single player or pay for the MMO part"
"The game's all too obvious goal is to evoke nostalgia for Ragnarok Online in those of us who's senility doesn't get in the way of it, and stylistically the game achieves it to a certain extent. The graphics very closely resemble what we all loved so much about RO. The music nearly hits the mark too. The monster design is uninspired in the beginning however. Whether it fares better later on in the game I cannot tell, because Tree of Savior bored me to tears with its uninspired combat system and its laughable (lack of) difficulty clearly catering to the braindead. Even the old grandpa Ragnarok Online did better in that regard and it was challenging, hence rewarding. That game is almost two decades old, mind you.The thing about Ragnarok Online though, it was a lightning in a bottle. Trying to recreate the magic you only set yourself up for a failure. Sadly and to nobody's surprise it is undoubtedly the case here."
"The game is poorly optimized even after several update/maintenance. Lag happens all the time, you can't talk/interact with NPCs -> hard to proceed quests, hard to spam skill due to delay, get disconnected from server quite often. There's also a problem i hate in this game is KS (kill steal), people keep appear out of nowhere and ks (especial archer class)."
"TREE OF HORRORPros:+ Beautiful art+ Diverse class system+ No grinding needed until very late in the gameCons:+ Infested with bots and gold sellers in town. I feel the urge to quit this game everytime I walk to town. Gold sellers spam in every channel to the point you literally can not chat in town without going to a very far corner. And the devs do nothing about this, they could have a mute function, chat cooldown, GM monitoring,etc but no, they're too busy thinking of new way to restict legit players+ As I said, they punish regular players, not bot. They're trying to reduce human interaction to the minimum. Everything is restricted, no trade between players, only 1 item on market without token, 48 hours wait before you can get the money from the items you sold, team storage requires token, etc. You're no different from a bot playing this game, grind, do quest, upgrade equipments, repeat. No human interaction needed except for partying.+ LAG! LAG! LAG! Even in the least populated channel the delay is horrible. Your character attack twice on screen and only one damage tick appears. And don't even bother with charging skills. Fully charged skill with minimal damage is the norm in this game.+ Stupid AI and ridiculously short buff duration. I get that they want to prevent bot from afk farming, but dumping down the game just for that is ridiculous. Your pet, your summoned, your converted mobs, etc are stupid as hell. They do nothing and have no damage. The only thing they do is making your lag worse. Buff duration is too short to make support classes worth while, most of the time the priests don't even bother buffing you because it's such a hassle to rebuff every minute. And did I tell you that the buff aoe is so small that you'll miss most of the time?+ A lot of game mechanics are not explained in the game. You have to read on the forums for that.+ The game is no where near polished enough for open beta. This is more like early access. You literally have a dozen quests with descriptions like this ""Kill %s"", ""Find %s"", ""Get %s"". And it is near unplayable without a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fanmade addons because the game UI design is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.In conclusion, don't play this game unless you have a lot of time to waste, because that's essentially all you'll do in this game."
"The game could be great but the people handling it (imc) is treating it like crap, its been years now the game is still not optimized properly, the events are somewhat exploited allot and they don't do much to improve the game, they just keep throwing a new content but for the past years little improvement has been made on the game itself, lag spikes are high, bots, exploiters, cheaters have taken most if the servers, since the game hasn't been treated properly the community itself is toxic now...."
"Framerate issues and lots of gold spams in game. Can't imagine what the framerate would be like when the game goes FTP next month and population grows. Gold spam is what I see on chat 99% of the time, which is pretty annoying."
"I'm a current Korean server player and tried Steam server just because I was boring.Found pretty much texts were mistranslated. Critical mistranslations everywhere oh well. Actually, I saw that coming when I was a part of Tree of Savior English translation project team on Github for a short amount of time and I didn't need another day to figure out that translations are having tons of troubles. Most of them didn't match the original description because most of the translations were done via Korean -> Japanese(machine) -> English. Pretty possible that Kor->Jpn machine translation wrecked everything up, idk. After I've noticed such problems I suggested the team to do a whole review on everything, I've even told an IMC employee who came to our discord chatroom that things are going completely wrong and they need to hire a professional translator to get things right but he just laughed and did nothing. That was the reason why I left the team. I'm not going to insult my former teammates but sorry guys, I value your enthusiasm but your works were meaningless. Please don't b**ch those guys, they are also victims. They just loved the game and have dedicated their time, efforts, skills to make the game readable to every English player. I'd say IMCgames is the one to blame. All their fault.If you still love this game much, come to Korean server."
"Game is pretty much unplayable at this point. Most servers ( cannot speak for all) are extremely unstable. SEA Server is basically a hit or miss thing. Ping spikes, DCs, crashes, you name it. The game is basically an early alpha product. Its extremely unpolished and rushed to make quick buck. It IS playable and you can like it for what it is, but if you have any standarts you will quickly notice the flaws and its gonna put you off. theres currently more cons than pros if you compare to any other ""Free"" mmo out there.The support is generally bad. Ive asked a lot of questions and reported a lot of bugs that affected my character in various ways (mostly negative). And you will always get the generic ""Thank you for reporting this, we will forward it to our development team"" or ""We have no current plans to blabla"" answer.The community is sadly not one of the best out there. Just go through the official forum and see for yourself.The game design gets basically ""worse"" the higher you get in levels. Quests become more and more annoying, and the pace slows down. Lacking endgame content, or actual high level content, forces players to grind out their remaining levels. Theres no real PVP in the game (no rewards whatsoever). Guilds currently also no real value aside from being a community and having access to some minor things that no one makes use of.ITOS (steam) also currently does not get ANY balance patches that kTOS gets, so the games balance is currently very well thrown off and you are better off not playing melee characters, unless its for tanking. Theres also no ETA when those balance patches will come.Music is overrated. Its definitely better than other games these days, but its mostly just funky techno like music, which doesnt really fit the game all to well. (very unlike RO/Granado espada)"
"Now that free to play is out i will update my review.The good-Music is amazing-Even without min maxing most classes are useful in some way-Classes are usually fun to play.-I enjoy the art styleThe bad-Tooltips for some skills are still missing information or not showing cooldown timers.-Some skills are broken-Terrible pet AI for the classes that use them-Poor leveling experiance through certain level ranges, This can be mitigated and avoided with planning but new players coming in blind will get stuck in the 160ish-186 zone with a terrible grind.-No UI resize controls or way to move UI features.-Need an addon to show exact experiance gain-Dungeon runs are capped at 3 runs per day, In the beta it was 5 per dungeon per day idk why they changed it-No trading money between alts, Money is tied to the character that gets it making crafting classes less useful for players-Cant directly trade boss cards which 3 different classes use for skills Wugushi, Necromancer, and Sorcerer-Bots so many bots and no real system to remove bots in place. You can report them but its not really helping the situation. They do ban bots but what they are doing does not seem to affect the rate of bots at all especially on the weekends when all the gms take a break.-The game is terribly optimized and it shows, massive slowdowns and lagfests during world boss fights even on powerful computers-For a grinding game the spawn rate is terrible expect 5+ minute wait times to kill things on many high level maps especially if you are not alone on the map. The spawn rate is still terrible in ftp they completely ignored this issue outside of one patch note early that had no real effect on the mob respawn problems.IMC did not fix much of anything from the early access to the free to play release. This game has so much potential but it feels like IMC is trying kill it with poor support. If IMC can get their act together this game will be great but so far i dont have much hope for it."
"Awesome game, deserves better, but the devs have a lot of restrictions if you dont pay the monthly 9$ to go premium. Very grindy, have to be into that kind of thing. 80 different classes with various skills that you can combine based on your first class choice."
Pros- Great Graphics- Great Soundtrack- Diverse Classes- Achievements and CollectionsCons- Premium Limitations- Pet System is Weak- Crafting is lame- Map sizes are to small and linear- Monster AI sucks- Monster have no unique features it feels like im killing the same mob with just a different skin and stats- NO THIS IS NOT THE SUCCESOR OF RAGNAROK ONLINE to much differences on game mechanics and design.
"I liked the charming look of ToS, the stat & skill customization, and the variety of classes...  but that wasn't enough to keep me or friends I came with interested in the game.  I was the last of my group to quit because I was stubborn and wanted to keep giving this game a chance, but the game just wasn't getting better.-CONS-*IMC (the company that developed the game)*      -Don't communicate with their playerbase enough      -Nothing gets done in a timely manner      -They put stupid restrictions on everything      -They let game breaking bugs continue to plague ToS to this very day      -Forums have no moderators      -Forums have no community manager to talk with the playerbase      -There are gamebreaking bugs that have been in the game since the beginning with no acknowledgement from IMC *Game bugs*     -People in a party get stuck (can't move or use skills) whenever someone in the same party starts a cut scene     -The goddess saule quest still is buggy for characters that started the quest when the game first came out     -Disconnections while trying to switch characters     -People are exploiting game breaking bugs             -Unbreakable weapon upgrades bug             -Infinite party members bug             -Druid class transformation crashing game channelsThe game breaking bugs that I just listed have been first talked about on 7/18 and now it's 7/21 with no fix and people are still crashing channels and freely upgrading weapons without having to lose potential on the weapon.  IMC made a short message on their site on 7/19 about it.  They haven't done any thing in the game to fix any of it and they've made no post on the forums.  People have suggested temporary fixes like temporarily making the druids unable to use the  transform skill til they can come up with a more permanent solution, but IMC won't do any thing about it.*PvP in the game is lackluster*         -The only PvP are duels and consensual GvG         -There's no reward for doing GvG         -There's no battlegrounds/arenas*Guilds*        -The guild leader MUST be a templar to make a guild        -Guild can only hold up to 35 people when level'd        -Guild list doesn't show what class the people currently are        -Guild missions don't work most of the time        -Nothing in the game makes guilds unique from eachother (no guild buffs, castles, etc... like you find in other games)*Leveling*        -Quests dry up when you get to 230+        -You MUST grind monsters for hours in a party to get your last levels.*End-game*        -The only thing you'll find yourself doing once you reach 280 is the only end-game instance called Earth Tower,            grinding mobs or world bosses for money, or making a new character.*Bots and gold sellers*        -I've come across bots on every map and channel in the game        -The gold sellers are annoying spamming in the cities with their huge chat bubbles that get in the way*Character look customization*       -Can only choose from a small list of hairstyles and can't even choose the hair color when making a character       -Can only choose black, pink, blonde, blue, or white hair later in-game through achievements       -Can only choose different hair styles by paying for it in their cash shop-PROS-*Character stat and skill customization*       -Can freely choose what stats and skills you want your character to have*Classes*       -Variety of classes that you can put together on one character*Music**Art style*The pro's couldn't keep me and others I know playing the game.  Just way too many bugs, lack of care from IMC, boring PvP, and boring end-game."
"I played this game for a bit now and i can not truly recomend it. The grind is lame, i was lvl 145 and no monster were attacking me or barely did anyway.The game at that point was very easy, too easy. im sure the real fun start once you reach end game but nothing really help you get there in a plesent way. You are ""forced"" to do main quest (orange) because they give stats to your character and it would have been ok if it was a single main quest but after lvl 70ish it split into 10+ main quest and some main quest are just different starting area. While grinding those main quest you dont get much exp because you alredy super lvled.You are stuck with the stats and ability you choose unless you pay a lot of money to get them reset but no mater what you are stuck with your choices of classes, regardless of updates and changes.The game is just not that fun to play."
"In this games current state, I would not reccomend. There are SOOO many issues , it makes it hard to enjoy. save your $50. Until they fix the problems, this game is a waste of time."
"Hey everyone,a long time a go I decided to try this game. It was directly after the release. Personally I had a lot of problems with the game back then. There were a lot of bugs and leveling was rather hard. As following I stopped playing after a few hours. Especially because I was playing other games like League of Legends and Ragnarok Online at the same time.Nevertheless, when I quitted with RO in June 2017 I decided to give Tree of Savior another try. Back then I noticed that the GMs and Developers added a lot of updates and improvements to the game. I played it actively for about 15 weeks then. Due to time problems regarding my RL I made a break again.About two weeks a go I decided to start with this game again, because i got more time now. As far as I can say the general gameplay feels rather good now. I will cover the main aspects of the game for people who are interested in the game:Artstyle & Music: 9/10I really like this two ones. I am playing on a 4K monitor currently. The graphic and artstyle are amazing most of the time. It's a really cute anime style graphic. I really like running through pretty maps while hearing the awesome background music. The artstyle & music have always been a driving force for the game. Some of the songs are a little bit too much techno for me. That's why I haven't given 10 out of 10 points.  Recently we had a lag reducing update, which helped a lot  players, who have got a rather bad PC. However I am using an ultra strong gaming computer - but somethimes when the screen is full of monsters and damage numbers it can still happen that you have small lags. Classes: 8/10There are ""MANY"" different classes in the game and you can choose between a LOT of different class & build choises. Most of the classes look either pretty cool or interesting. I have tried  Swordman, Archer, Barbarian, Highlander, Doppelganger, Mage, Necromancer, Sorcerer, Cyromancer, Archer, Ranger, Quraral Shooter, Falconer and Mergen so far. Most of them are pretty cool - especially Doppel, Falconer, Mergen and Sorcerer. Due to the huge number of classes there is kind of a small balancing problem. It's not possible to make every build in the game viable. As following some builds are stronger than others, which makes some people angry when they play PVP. PVE: 6/10The gameplay of the game is rather easy. Especially between level 1 and 250. You rather progress fast. As New or returning player (one month or more of absence from the game) you will receive huge Exp Boni. Regarding the questing I can not say that much. The opinions differ a lot there. Some people say that the story is great and that questing makes a lot of fun. Others say that questing is rather boring. Personally, I would rate the questing like it is in any other MMORPG out there. The questing in Blade and Soul & Tera is pretty much like it is in Tree of Savior. In my opinion it's fine. I do not love questing - but I am fine with doing it and it makes some fun too. Especially the backport featur the the quest NPCs is really cool. Most of the time you have got the choice between grinding, questing or making dungeons. Some of the maps, which are not used that often are rather unpopulated. However I still enjoy walking through them - seeing all the beautiful map features. In addition you got all the monsters for yourself then :) Regarding the endgame: The ""end game"" is mostly marked by: Dungeons (Normal Dungeons, Saalus, Uphill Defence, ET - Solmiki and Velcoffer - and more), Raids, gearing up, trying a lot of classes and different builds, Team Battle League (3 vs 3 PVP), GTW (Guild Battles PVP), making Quest Dailies, farming silver and some more small things. We will get the Rank 10 Update with a few new maps and things soon. As following the level cap will get increased again, which brings some more action back. Unfortunately, Tree of savior does not offer a lot of skill expression in PVE and PVP. As following it really depends on Equipment, Builds and effort. You will need to grind a lot for getting stronger. P2W VS FTP:The opinions differ a lot here. Of course, when you invest a lot of money into the game you will get advantages regarding the speed of your progress. However when you put a lot of time into the game you will gain mostly the same result. The Cash Shop mostly consists of costumes. In addition I want to point out that I like the 5-Free-TP-System. All players get 5TP [Cash-Shop-Currency] for free everyday. As following you can buy a lot of things from the Cash-Shop without using real money. However there is one thing, which I do not like that much named Blessed Cubes. They contain a lot of different items. All of them can be gained ingame through quests, farming, Events & the market. However one item named ""Diamond Anvil"" is a bit to overpowered in my opinion. It helps you with refining and some people consider this item as an P2W item. However, you can still get them for free or you can refine with other materials. Diamond Anvils inflated the enhancements of gear in the game . The ability to upgrade your gear and if it fails you maintain what ever enhancement level you were on and only lose a point of potential. Additional information: In addition IMC added some further game mechanics such as tradeable blessed Shards, Daily rewards, a Mercenary Post System, a Fishing System and more. Furthermore I like the Rank Reset Events, Returning Saivor's Events and Newbie Events, which are there from time to time. Apart from that IMC also frequently adds Events which offer special items and Exp-Buffs. Currently there are still a few aspects of the game, which I would like IMC to improve:- Sharing Silver between your own characters is a little bit limited.- 1x Market Spot per Character isn't enough. I would love to see an increasement of 5 Spots for non Token Players and 15 Spots for Token Players- I would love to see addons or official UI Changes, which allow players to hide NPC Names, Companion Names of your Companion or Companions of other players, HP and SP Information of Party Members [This is annoying because you can't see your own HP / SP under your character when you are next to party members]In general I am fine with the game. It is not a ""perfect"" game but it improves step by step and in my opinion it is worth playing. I am a big Ragnarok Online fan and as far as I can say - when you like Ragnarok you will definitely like Tree of Savior too. Kind regards,Alatariel"
"core of the game, classes, lvling up, weapons and such is excelent, its been YEARS since i got hooked into a game like this.The bad part is the optimization and lag issues but besides that this is a very good game, go ahead and try it!"
"19 Hours, Two Maintenances Later & One ban wave later exploit is still around in the game. Wanna play the game? Sure and be at risk of getting banned for playing the game. And oh look its the weekend now so expect 4-7 days too get unbanned.Trash game trash company complete incompetence from the devs, don't waste your time here.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2/04/18 Updated for 2nd AnniversaryAll i can say is. GG. You would think 1 year later the game would've improved but nope. It actually got worse. Bugs from closed beta are still active, bots are still running around, the economy is still being cucked. And the game still runs like trash."
"This game is highly addictive and does not have a high learning curve. I reccomend looking up leveling guides on the web. Honeslty I'm very surprised people don't know much about this game, it's amazing! A hidden gem. Please just try it out for yourselves."
This game is only for those who: 1. Want to make money through RMT 2. Love leveling up tons of alts because your main character will become trash sometime either by your mistakes or update patches 3. Love grinding 4. Love killing boss with 5 FPS5. Simply want to waste some time I quit because I'm not these kind of people. I am a lvl 250 plague doc who is sick of grinding.
"Hello I have a fletcher lvl 231 and after playing a lot since it became F2P I really start to see the truth of this game, this is all my opinion and things I have had to bear with while playing.If you are looking for a MMO that actually lets you be a trader with a free trading system, this is clearly not your game. ONLY if you have a token you can do 1:1 trades with other players, you can buy from the player market for a normal amount of silver which is not too bad. But sadly, most of those sellers are goldsellers and bots (Yes.. There are so many of those and sadly they don't seem to get banned and if they are they will simply create a new account and carry on with the same business) Tokens are a must if don\t have one, you will not paly on the same level as token users because it gives you so many perks.You have delay from 30mins to 2hours once you have registered an item in the market.SILVER can't be traded and instead IMC had 'the great idea' of making an item called talt which is used as if it was silver, as of right now, talts are worth around 6k silver which means that you will need an insane amount of talts to be able to pay for a weapon that is worth lets say 4millions. All of this is mainly focused on trying to avoid goldsellers and whatnot, but it is a tragic decision on IMC's hands, after all they're showing that they're that vulnerable to goldsellers that their game was modified by them.Maps in this game are almost as simple as the quest but they are somewhat nicely done when it comes to colours and artstyle but extremely simple and straight forward, dont worry you wont get lost.Let's move on the quests, the main quest storyline is not great but not bad either but seriously if you want to quest this is not your game either, I'd go play The Elder Scrolls Online which has way better quests. The side quests are ridiculous.. I've tried every MMO in the last years and I have not found any game so badly done when it comes to quests diversity, all this game does is to make you do quests that you either have to kill a rather easy mini-boss or you have to protect an area/someone. It is horribly repetitive after a while. Some quests are bugged and unable to be done since closed beta but there are also some cool hidden quests. Also, the XP card system is nice and refreshing but makes the game slightly easy by the first levels.The game is too confusing, no matter who you ask they most likely will not be able to give you a clear answer even if they have been playing since closed beta. When it comes to claases and specially stats, the game is really messed up and confusing, no one really knows anything and if they know then you'll ask someone else and will tell you something different, there is not a clear pattern on what to follow even top rater builds end up being really bad at the end. This all leads me to speak about the stat system, plain and simple which is good but with a really and huge problem, if you misclick or mess up slightly with your stats you can say goodbye to that character, meaning you won't be able to reset your spent points by all means.Dungeons ar enothing special either, when you get lucky you will have a cleric in the team if not prepare to die so many times that your entire gear will be red and broken, amtchmaking is not too bad but sometimes ti will get bugged and if you dont cancel it you will be stuck into it forever and I mean forever.I almost forgot to talk about another huge issue that this game has, lag is a major issue. If you want to keep a steady pace while questing I'm afraid it will not be possible due to the NPC lag, basically you'll have to stand next to it after clicking on it furiously for atleast 1 second and maintenances have not fixed this whatsoever. Also to mention that if you use a skill that consumes an item, let's say you consume and skill that consumes an arrow well, then.. You're most likely dead if they mobs are around your level or if your character is a glass cannon this being simply because you will be frozen on place after using that skill, I'm not sure if this is a lag related issue or something to do with the coding but this is really annoying and will most likely get you killed while playing.I won't talk about the community because in a MMO with many players on it you'll run into every kind of person.But overall, I expected something better but I ran into a repetitive game that feels that has been done in order to make goldsellers' life hard and which has failed poorly."
"Okay, it's been two and a half years since the initial (and chaotic) launch. I'm not sure if it's because I was absolutely burned out after both the CBTs and the really rocky OBT/Launch, but I can't really feel angry about this game like I did back then. I've been playing it recently and I've noticed that they've made a lot of effort to address concerns that were present at launch, and the beginning of the game doesn't feel like anywhere close to the massive chore it was before. I was originally very cautious of the attitude IMC had about their cash shop. However, if we compare the cash shop to a game like Path of Exile, it seems pretty fair what they're doing here; and it's really worth mentioning they have given the community quite a lot of freebies. I'm not sure we can compare it entirely to POE, given the gameplay flow is quite different, but at least on the topic of F2P cash shops the argument stands. I believe I should at least change this review from a ""no"" to a ""yes"" simply because it's actually fun now (ping and fps issues aside)."
"From my experience in the 2nd closed beta:Pros:+great art+amazing class system, lots of customization+combat is fun, and it has very satisfying sound effects (which makes the grinding feel a little bit better)+beautifully done soundtrack+supports controllers/game pad+cool ranking system+exploration system, and a lot of maps to explore+hidden classes!+guild pvp (although i've never done it)+beautiful UI+i really feel like there's more pros but i haven't played the game in a few months so i can't remember xDCons:-limited character customization (all you can customize at character creation is the class and hair style :/)-the restrictions placed on players who aren't buying tokens (premium service) every month are a little ridiculous lol-$18 for a hair cut?!?!-exp cards in cash shop (+30% exp for an hour), makes the game a little pay to win-seriously wtf $18 for a single hair cut-personally, i think the questing is kind of boring and typical-very limited customization with clothes in general. to my knowledge, the only equipment that actually appears on your character in game is hats and costumes, but there aren't very many of these that are just fun to collect (especially costumes). even the cash shop costumes are lacking a bit. this is honestly my biggest negative point for this game because i really love customizing my character and making them look cool and unique.The game also has a lot of grinding, but I wasn't sure which category to put that in since some people like grinding and others don't. I personally don't mind it.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game (especially to people who like old school mmorpgs). It has its negatives, but it's a hell of a lot better than most other new mmos out there."
"With all the bugs that still left in game from beta test (which IMC have no ability to fix it all this time), badly optimized game, lag/freezing prone unstable server, ever increasing number of RMT spam and more auto farming bots (some with hacks) in sight.. Future of ToS looks grim.Game is fun while last, but with all these problems, I'm sure this game won't last long.Enjoy it while you can before this thing crash lands in oblivion."
"Do not recommend to buy it, game is kinda broken at the moment: lots of restirictions to f2p, broken trade system, no sociality, amount of bugs like in first beta tests, huge lags and devs who not responde to players community"
"All my play time is just updates, so this review is not about the game itself. The store page needs a clearer warning that the game is in early access. The game WILL be free-to-play, but currently it isn't, so the free-to-play tag should be removed. They also need to move on from their build-in update system and use Steam updates instead, so the game is ready to be played when you want."
"July 5 2016...For those players reading this and maybe a IMC staff guys that read the consumers reviews:This game its not finished, they need to do alot of work with those bugs, the server side lag and other things related to gameplay.The F2P model and Premium model just are not right, they need to change restrictions for good, even made a new model for a monthly fee I dont mind at all! as long I play a better game. Just copy the models from greaters companies like Blizzard, Riot or Arena Net (GW2 are a excelent example of succes).Well thats all I have to say about this very looking forwad game. This is coming for a player that got into RO between 2007-2013Oh yea one more thing to say...RO music had the peculiarity of stay on the same song if you are in a X zone, now in ToS we had a random playlist in every zone, IMO this is not a good feel at all (miss that epicness of thanatos tower floors)The art its very good as was on RO, congrats!6/10..."
" Well well well i hit 200 hours now for my review! First off IMC is like a bunch of goldfish in a bowl over there, it seems to me they are doing nothing correct at all. Don’t even bother buying XP tombs or dungeon resets in the cash shop, you will just end up getting them for free because of how much IMC screws up! Oh and if you enjoy only being able to run 2 dungeons with no premium token or 3 with a premium token have fun randomly getting this error called commander load fail and yes, it counts as one of your dungeon runs for the day and IMC doesn’t care about your time at all. IMC is so proud of their ant size list of banned bots, gold sellers and BR exploiters in game yet it seems like they didn't even scratch the surface. Heres some fun little stories of playing Tree of Fish Heads, first off they loveee to give a short amount of time notice for anything! So the first time this 24 hour maintenance bs pops up it was a whole 1 hour notice before the game was going to be taken offline, and for icing no the cake they did nothing! Nothing at all during the 24 hours that the game was down!THEN surprise surprise surprise yet another 24 hour maintenance and this time with zero compensation! it took them 48 hours to give out the compensation! But don’t forget when the non american servers got their 24 hour maintenance, ours went down yet again! It took IMC 3 hours to notice this and just popped our server back on like nothing happened! Where’s the compensation for that IMC! Do you think we’re stupid?Last fun little side note, the Market (Auction House) is horrible! You can’t trade silver to anyone or ever your other characters, so you have to trade random items for other items of value. And I guess TALT is the new currency in the game because that's all you can use to buy stuff from people in a trade! Then when an item sells in the market you have to wait 48 hours or more to collect your silver! Yes I said FORTYEIGHT HOURS for your silver to be available to you from your sold item AND with no token you automatically lose 30% of the silver! And you can only list one item at a time if you don’t have a premium token! This game is just turning into another P2W mess.P2W P2W P2W"
"Awfully buggy in this ""MMORPG"" you be lucky if your party goes along in a instanced quest, even when everyone is indeed synchronized in the same quest you might not get instantiated in the boss fight, along with your partners or might have to do the quest n times where n is the number of party members.Party system is awful, you can't get your party in the same chain quest without a horrible amount of voice chat and constant and stressful check. Asking: Is everyone in the ""quest name""? when there are 5 people is very bad. There a plenty of good examples of games whom did this right and this game does nothing of it.Some quests are downright broken and won't work at all, others are poorly planned like planting a bomb on a mob that spawns every 5 minutes twice (while other 10 full parties of 5 players dispute them with you).Poorly optimized game so you get High MS and low FPS, it goes as low as 3FPS if there is anyone attacking near you. I found out that using the integrated graphic card helps in the FPS, but then it takes around 5 minutes to load a map.Because of all that, all the boss fights get really stupid. Doing a encounter with high MS is already very frustrating, now try doing that with low FPS. Simply dysfunctional.Constant crash, the game stop responding at random or you get disconnect from a channel after changing mapsThe game is 3 days old and already can't deal with spamming bots, imagine when this thing goes open.Overall I felt like a pre alfa tester, I can't recomend this to anyone."
"As of now, IMC has removed regional pricing.They said people have been abusing this using VPN, but they're really just blowing smoke.1 - You cannot use another currency on Steam unless you change your Steam region. This process has a ""cooldown"" (a month or 2), and if done enough will raise some red flags on your account.2 - When you do that and try to make a purchase you will actually need a credit card with an address matching said country. You will also be ticking a box that says you attest to be residing in said country, and Valve can take action against your account if found out otherwise.This is just a lie for IMC to make some money to compensate the loses they get from BR bolleto fiasco. If they really want to prevent the exploit and fighting  bots, why not just remove the founder for now since f2p is coming in 8 days, amirite? Nope and here's why and it will be related,,,TO THE NEW PLAYERS! THIS IS IMPORTANT PLEASE READ!Please do not buy the updated founder pack. If you're not from Murica or any first world country, avoid the upcoming sales completely. You might say to yourself its better to buy this founder pack since there is a 30% sales! No you're just gonna get scammed buddy. You better off buying Witcher 3+seasonal pass and still have spare change than buying this incomplete game that is filled with bots and limit you on every single aspect of the game. Just wait for the f2p if you wanna try this."
"Product received for freeI don't really ever write reviews so bear with me. I really so much wanted to love this game, as I was a huge fan of RO. It's not a terrible game and I actually ended up enjoying it, though not half as much as I wanted to. I was extremely disappointed when the DLC that was implemented offered about half as much reward for twice as much money as most other NA games. Customer service was at first quick to answer, but very short on satisfaction or comprehension or both and finally no answer for a couple of weeks. I'd really like to try this game again, if any decent company were to run it and if many tweeks were made. IMC is just not a good company to run the English version of this game in my opinion."
"They had 2 years to fix a game that tanked completely in the Korean region. But instead they kept their resources at 100% in Art, 0% in Server Stability, 0% in Engine Optimization, 0% in just depth. Ragnarok Online (the first one), is still better than this.If I still had my stream history from when they launched just the Supporter/Backer only server. It could not even handle that handful of connections. I could not even imagine how it would handle public release on full-scale.The depth is on the same level of Maple Story.I'm sorry for the person who bought this for me on my stream. I played it for as long as I could stay connected in the Supporter/Backer server, which was 4.3 hours."
"Overall the game is Amazingly incomparable compared to recent MMORPGs we have to date.This game has everything, from a wide range of classes to outstanding fluid gameplay to unlimited number of builds you could think of and also various and interesting quests (which I don't see how people see it linear because there are points in the game where you have to grind a bit before moving on with questing.)It is actually funny how people are crying about the Token system. Tokens are 500k each minimum right now in the game and it is not that hard to earn silver. Even if you aren't a TP buyer you can still buy Token if you know how to garner enough silvers accordingly, it's not that hard. Why cry about a system that FIXES economy rather than crying about a broken economy in the mere future which kills the game even more. So, take your pick?JUST SAYING YOU CAN'T RATE DOWN THE GAME JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK AROUND WITH THE DUMB TRADE SYSTEM. THINK ABOUT HOW THE GAMEPLAY IS AND NOT HOW YOU CAN'T TRADE AND SCAM PEOPLE OKAY?"
"""TOS will be a F2P game"" When, ♥♥♥♥♥? i've had it in my library for a month, and I believe at first they said april 28th, then when I tried it they said some time in may, not giving any sort of date. If its not free don't list it as free. I'll update this review when I actually get a chance to play it, therefore I cannot reommend it yet"
"It's sooooo boooring.It sucks the life out of you while you play. It drains your soul of any warmth or happiness you've ever had and leaves nothing but a dead, drooling husk. You will become stupid if you play this game for too long. It's stupifying. It ruins your day. It goes into your living room and demands you repalce your carpet with walnut chips and paint flecks and then turns your dog inside out. My poor dog...Run... Run while you still can...Save yourselves..."
"If gamers who dont like grinding and doing quests. YOU WILL BORING SO FAST AND I CAN GUARANTEE THAT.But for me, this game is so far so good. I like how classes system work . You can build your own classes style. I like it. But as I say.... play it for yourself and then gives it reviews."
"This game's server latency issues are the worst I have ever experienced.  I have been through countless game launches, both as player and working in the industry on the other side.  I have never seen such an unplayable game while claiming to be at launch.  This game is in a pre-alpha state, and is not what I paid for.I have never requested a refund for a game title before, in my nearly two decades of gaming.  This is a first.  Save yourself the headache, and don't buy it."
" unoptimized game (10 or below fps on crowded areas) server lag failing the skill to execute, resulting in 2-3 seconds to freeze your character  bots market manipulation little to no scaling (low ranking skills become useless, a waste of skill points and a waste of quickslots) class discrimination (AKA: if your not this build, then ♥♥♥♥ off) horrible spawn rates combined with very low drop rates (especially when its a mob that spawns 3 max at a given time) exp tome isnt exactly 30% but a lie because its additive when grinding maps have massive exp multiplier (nice compensation <_<) no skill queues (ping dependent skills arnt at its full potential) squire scammers world boss hogging (no chance for others, to go self found) still has plenty of bugs (ex. overleveling attribute or shinobi clones) weirdly IMC doest include balance patches lack of diversed items, making the majority of the players go after 1 item *cough* petamion *cough* more hidden classes incoming with no class resets (best to play this game after its FULLY released) pets are the mouse clickers worse nightmare horrible crit rate scaling (crit rate goes down per level unless you keep feeding dex) some mobs have 100% chance to freeze, knockdown, sleep... combined with a very low cooldown no diminishing returns for crowd control effects resulting in permanent CC -> https://youtu.be/T8j0BdL0eo4 guilds cant choose to go neutral resulting in non-pvp guild griefing global instanced dungeons & missions are limited and are easily capped resulting in failed queues (lol F2P coming soon) - FIXEDwill change to 'recommend' if majority if the problems are fixed"
"I was hooked immediately. Its exactly what I was looking for and even better.You need to know what you're looking for, I was completely satisfied. I'm currently using a lower spech laptop because my better one is inaccesable, so I was looking for something that worked and was fun to play. Took me long enough but the search was worth it. I took a leap of faith here because the minimum recommendations are 8gb Ram.I looked at the graphics and figured maybe I could lower them ingame but it worked perfectly fine with my 2gb Ram without changing anything. The graphics are beautiful and unique. You feel like someone actually put some heart into designing the game, that means a lot to me and adds a lot of enjoyment while playing.I'm fully served here. A good rule of thumb is to disregard steam reviews and just try a game out for yourself. Unless youre a person without their own opinions, then read ahead and disregard any game that someone else didn't like.Update:Can't find any of the other problems described by others on here. Theres no lags nor freezes nor bugs for me. Just change the channel if you're lagging at places with a high density of players?The servers are fast and everythings loading just fine. There's also PLENTY of people playing at all times. The game is alive."
"You could have just copied Ragnarok Online, with a giant *open* world , where each map is large and has certain monsters that have a set strength where there is no set in stone zone level and dungeons are just another map no different to any other area with mobs, where you can level wherever you like or can without being forced along a linear questline with the premise of kill and get xp in a class system that is fun and makes sense and a combat system that is simple but actually works.But nah, we only get the cute art style and the great soundtrack. Is that really the only thing they thought was worth taking from RO? Why do we still have sterotypical western MMO tropes seeping into eastern MMOs now as well as every single western MMO? Why do developers STILL think that to make a successful MMO you need some intricate combat system that will never be good, because MMO combat is never good, but it is better to make a boring combat system that works than a boring combat system that doesn't. Most of the classes in Ragnarok played by holding left click, Runescape had a combat system where you left click once and wait until the enemy died for crying out loud, but it worked, and those games were highly successful. And stop forcing sheep hearding, mandatory linear quests for god sake, give players the means to find out how to level on their own.Anyway, it's basically RO with the entire gameplay system cut out of it to be replaced with ♥♥♥♥♥♥, overused and boring modern MMO tropes that I listed above, plus a very very terrible version of the class system from RO.The positives-Art style-MusicThe negatives that I care about-Ultra clunky keyboard/controller based movement/combat system with practically zero targeting and you feel you have little control over your abilities, highly sensitive to ping, feels horrid when you aren't close to the server. The choice of this movement and combat system in a RO-esque/top down view MMO is utterly bizzare, the fact this isn't point and click like Dofus, Wakfu, RO and other top down games I'll never be able to work out. Why did the developers feel they had to be totally different here, but copy tropes everywhere else?-Zones are horrifically small and feel totally crowded, made worse by the fact mobs spawn clustered in portions of the already tiny zone rather than randomly placed, your quest area is potentially smaller than the screen.-Mandatory linear questing. You linearly progress through the zones, the ones you pass through, you won't return to. There is absolutely no open world elements whatsoever, you cannot go anywhere you want when you start the game like you can in RO or many other games for that matter. Even WoW has more choice on where/how you level than this game. This is the worst part that makes the game totally different to RO, terrible and destined to be a failure. The modern obsession with this system is a plague and developers can't seem to work out that if you do this your game dies most of the time. Add this with the tiny zones and you get double the cancer. What if I told you that it is possible to make an MMO without quests, or have them as optional side quests or ways to unlock other things? Well you can and I hope to♥♥♥♥♥♥MMO developers realise this soon.-Class/skill system is kind of like they wanted to make it similar to RO, but change it so it is unique. Cept it is super stupid because early classes have limited abilities and branch out into new and totally different ones that don't actually complement each other. You have to get bow skills as an archer but then you can eventually get skills for daggers, but when you have daggers, whats the point of the bow skills you just learned. Half the time the old skills are weak and redundant later anyway. I'm not sure why they added 5 billion different classes and grouped them under a mere 4 starting classes. RO had 6, and they branched off into two more, then never branched again, but the starting classes had skills relevant to the classes they turned into, ToS doesn't.There's more issues but there's no point mentioning them because of the reasons above. And no this isn't a first day rant."
"Edit 3 minutes after I posted this, so I decide to log on today just to see if anyone actually plays still.and apparently there is a glitch that is not letting most people on the game including me lol.Yeh, i'll never look at a game ran by IMC again.(Before you read all this let me just put the most important thing at the top, the reason why I dont recommend this game Is because even when everyone on steam and on the forums is talking about the party bug and everything else that makes the game unplayable. IMC had the audacity to push out a Question and Answer, talking about some cash shop costumes. Like are you serious dude? the game is in this kind of shape and you are over here answering questions about a bunny boy costume? No, bye.)Played the game for a little bit.Love everything about it but for all new players,please turn back now. If you like this game and startplaying it, you are going to be disappointed when you realizeTHEY GIVE NO FKS ABOUT THE GAME. LOLOmg so bad such fail. I've never seen a game that has a patch every week BUT MAKES IT WORSE AND BREAKS THE GAME WITH EVERY PATCH!!"
"i did enjoy the game story , mystery , Adventurehowever i did see that the game move to more pay to winand time pass my friends left the gamei recomend this game if you have group of people who will play with you"
"I bought the expensive pre-release bundle, played for a few hours, didn't use ANY of the items from the expensive bundle and decided to put the game aside.Fast forward few months, I decided to try the game again.My account was banned, support took around 4 months to answer my email requesting an explanation.The answer was: ""Upon our investigation, it has been determined that your account has violated the terms of service and EULA of the game and we have sufficient evidence of this infraction.Due to this, your game access has been permanently restricted and will not be released.""NICE!Piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥company."
I wish it was better...I wanted it to be great. You just need to spend SOOO much time grinding to get anywhere and honestly without a guild system (locked by a class that no one is) or a easy way to find parties (too low population and exp penalty when outside a certain level range..added to a razy amount of levels in the game). The token gold sink is just annoying and solves nothing...Bots and gold sellers are everywhere. It feels so much like Ragnarok online that it makes me wanna play but the problems it suffers from always makes me stop playing. I also guarentee you will spend 40-50 hours playing and then fizzle out because it will feel like a slow grind solo game that makes you want to level to show off to your guild? no guild. Your party friends? no party. To grind some more? yes...you want to that? seriously?
"Updated Review: IMC has shown their true faces. They want players to pay ~20 EUR for a month of token. I can buy AAA games and play them for several months, instead of paying 40+ EUR for two months of token in ToS. I would be fine with it, if the game was optimized. But it is goddamn auwful. And don't wait for devs to trully optimize it (since they would need to do a complete overhaul of the game code).  I can play GW2 on high settings with constant 60 FPS during WvWvW (where zerg vs zerg with 50+ ppl is pretty common). Here I get 10-15 FPS in dungeons and 5 FPS in cities. People with much better rig than mine don't get more than 5 FPS in ~10-men PVP. Just check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gradUiqfmkJust stay away from this game, like from plague. If you need ROstalgia, just find yourself some good private server and play there.ToS is just a cash-cow that IMC decided to milk hard till it dies."
"i bought 2 100tp for this game and i only got 1. this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game scam people. customer support always reply "" We would like to inform you that we already forwarded your concern regarding the TP delay issue for review and processing. We ask your patience and understanding with this matter."" after a month of so many reports im quitting this game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game"
"Casual but not so casual - The game is simple enough to pick up, simple keys, simple mechanics however, class advancement planning is necessary as there is no way to revert / reset your selections as there is no item in the game to allowing that, not even cash item. Quests are simple but the flow of the game feels broken."
"till level 100 you are like wtf how can this game get so many negative reviews ? then surprise after lvl 100 all makes sensethe game is boring and lazy, the devs dont pay attetion to the community.all this game has to offer is classes NOTHING more, i'm not saying that the classes are bad but thats only it, a class simulator. Dungeons oh boy haha, thatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you like pve you should run now.dungeons can be done only 2 times per day / 3 if you have your token active. wtf ?market of the game is bs, you can place max 10 items with active token. wtf? haters will say ""anti bot bro shut up"" â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you that is what i call bad dev.all you do in this game is grind or quests, nothing more. my friends for a game released in 2016 thats so bad that makes me cry, i know some people like that type of game but it'll fail coz ITS 2016 and NOT 2000, if imc wants to get more people to play they need to adapt.tl/dr : Run! dont download or support this game till imc learn to do what the community wants. BUT ignore all i said if you want a game to grind and grind and grind and grind and hmm grind some more ? for new classes and MAYBE a good pvp. coz pve sucks.  "
"I was really curious when I saw this game on my suggestion list, but it turns out the beginning of the game is confusing and the graphics isn't that good. Excitement turns into disappointment. Talk about ""That escalated quickly"". The creators of this game should do something and not ignore the low recommendations this game has been receiving."
"For me the gameplay is good the class design wasnt bad but there are alot of downside in the game. One is the party cannot defeat boss bug, the game lag a lot. many times the game just wont start. this bugs had caused many of my friends to lose interst quickly. please fix these bugs as soon as possible."
"One of the worst business module ever.- P2P Trade Restriction. (pay us to unlock for a month)- A single market sell slot with 30% fee. (pay us to sell 9 more item)- I don't mind pay-to-level faster but what the hell with Pay-to-get more buff.They said it was implemented to fight gold sellers.Did this affect gold seller ""No""Did this affect real player ""Yes""If you want money, fine, do a subscription base or one time paying. Even for a totally balanced free to pay game, free of all pay to win aspect, I still gladly support those by buying cosmetic, but definitely not this game.They ruined their own beautiful game."
"I pre-ordered the headstart and played for a good couple of months. I stopped for a year and came back w/ a friend who wanted to try this game out. The community slightly dwindled, but the towns were still pretty populated. We really liked this game, until a new game we pre-ordered came out. Another year later, another friend wanted to try it and I started playing it again. I thought, ""Maybe this time i'll play this game even longer!"" Nope, after about a month; we dropped the game to play a new game that came out at that time.tl;dr - This game used to be my drug, as I always came back to play it..Music and Animation is great. I do recommend this game, because the gameplay is fun; especially when you play with friends. The last time I played, there was barely anyone that wanted to do anything group related. Quick join dungeons were available, but started to get boring for my taste."
"First thing that happened to me in game: I didn't understand what my team lodge name was. The game said I could change it later, so I picked my clan tag. I did not realize the consequence of this seemingly innocent action. When I found out that this is more like a username rather than a group tag to identify with, I went to change it and found the first paywall. I never even logged in. From what my friends have told me, the worst is only ahead if you chose to play this predatory ""game"". Enjoy this fee to pay experience if you can.They could have made a player out of me, but they just wanted to make a payer out of me. Uninstalled."
"Many unique features and special limitations all around. Reached maxed lvl of 330 putting up with ridiculous bugs like killing party mate and myself with a certain skill. Which doesn't get fix even after many months. What made me quit is the weirdest implementation in a game of all I've experience. An end game material which I just can't think of a better reason they have for us other than quit this buggy game by implementing a limited item with high requirement to get and EXPIRATION on that damn cube, that gives you that material by chance, along with a VAGUE description of what to do with it. Just to make a fool out of some people, it expired and can no longer get anything. Of course I too filed a ticket, general response that it was an intended implementation as stated by their staff.If you are willing to pay some kind of subscription for full feature and join the game of bugs, go ahead."

"stats and skill reset only for real money = Pay2Win(most important fun factor is building and forming his character , that game how it is now feels like its made to delay time and force players to pay money. Making/lvling a new character after invested 100 hours of time into your first character sux the lifeforce out of you  becouse of the high anmount of quests and becouse there are no fair grinding spots (fair =high mob spawn rate and high anmount of mobs at same point) ,  dungeons helps only limited)Classes are unbalanced (  some are weak ,some feels useless/ worthless , some feels stupid like cleric classes = using items for using standart skills of the classes , if developers would change other classes like swordman class into this , maybe then they would see how it feels using ""Meat items"" for melee skillslags , bugs , dc´s and bots werent funkillers for me like for other players. Graphic is interesstingMusic is Nice even its bad made  , the high anmount of classes are a ""+""story is okey(played it on another account , dont wonnder i have 0,1 hours)"
"I started playing this and luckily I ran into the poor design and customer support before I spent more than 10 euro on this game. It is a good game for collectors but severely, severely grindy. It's not just killing mobs over and over, but in order to complete collections some of the mobs have normal drop rates for grinders, about 0.1% but the problem is that the mob may only have 2 spawn ever 5 min. So not only do you have to kill 100's of the mob, but you have to spend an enormous amount of time doing so. Better to have many spawns with a lower drop rate.But the real killer is the poor game design about some things. You can enchance your weapon in player shops, but to do so, you have to unequip it. If you forget to re-equip it and it gets sold to an NPC, good bye item. There is no buy back feature and if you ask for support, they don't even have a ""this is your one get out of jail free card"". Yes, this is what happened to me, I accidentally sold my weapon that I'd spent days grinding for. So good thing it happened to me early in the game so I know not to waste more time on a game that not only has poor design but also lacks customer support.It's not all bad though, they occationally clean out the bots and the spammers. The graphics are nice and the controls refreshingly simple. The classes are highly varied so you can design as you like, but as usual when there's a lot of class choices, only a few become really viable.If they would fix some of the design flaws or improve customer service, I could recommend this game, but in it's current state, I cannot do so."
Very color much game and fun too! Not very appropriate for the children because lots of murdering of color demons or something... Much GRIND yes very much! but then sometimes you drop an epic rare item and its cool again. time to murder more :D
"This game is alright sometimes, but when you have to wait 30 minutes after spamming a button to get into a dungon, only to have another group who came along after you and get lucky enough while also spamming the button to get into the dungeon before you because there's no queue system when the server ""exceeds capacity"" it makes you think there's a lot of crappy design flaws in this game.  Waste your time playing a game that actually lets you play the game.  3/10"

"I have some things to say to you that is beginning now: (Wall of text)Leveling for the first time is great, you don't know anything about the game yet and about what classes can do (Because of the shady skilll description). Then, the more you level, the more you know how messed up is your build, and how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ your choices were. So you level again and again. Some ranks even have hidden combos with other ranks, which would be great if every rank combo with each other. Some say that you need to research first to make class choices. I Agree with them. Only in Tree of Savior you see this crap of a system that makes you experience failure over success (Imitating life I guess?), and is rather easy to failure in build choices than success. Even if you research, you do not know what will come on the next class ranks. Your build could be great and an update comes and you are at the bottom.This leads to another topic that is balance: This game is hell of imbalanced, some classes make other classes impracticable, and those classes have no counter to them. It's like a pyramid system, if class A is not present, class B is dominant, and so on. In conclusion, this game takes no skill. It really doesn't.So you like the above systems. Well, this game have massive FPS drops making it impossible to play PvP 5v5 with descent FPS, don't even try to GvG or fight for World boss wihtout PowerPoint on, you need this for the slide presentation. That is not enough, every single update comes with bugs, lots of them. It takes a long time for the company to solve these problems, if it will ever be solved.In fact, there still exists gamebreaking bugs that are here since the beginning. Like the annoying freeze when casting a spell , you freeze for 2-3 seconds, can't walk, can't cancel the animation and in the end the spell does not come out. If only it was a lag issue, which is not, it's a code bug that happens with every single skill in the game. It's a self stun, by this time, you can consider this a feature of the game.There is one kinda positive thing about this game: The GvG battle reward your Guild with TP (the real money currency in game). It create competition between guilds. Kinda because if you are beginning now, you will have to do a serious, serious, serious grinding on multiple characters to get your skill enhancements and equipments. Or swap your credit card, now that this game is getting more pay to win the more the time passes. I say this because new players will have a long road to compete for that free TP: There are skill enhancements, which costs dozens of millions just for 1 damaging skill , and the Awakening system, which is a daily thing. Not pay to win only because of the time wall, but because of the company changes and additions to the TP shop. You can get exclusive items, huge boost items, gamebreaking items only by paying.I definitely would not recomment this game, not even a ""give it a try, it is free to play""."

"Product received for freeWell the game it's fun, it has a lot of good things but. and it is a HUGE BUT IMC is doing everything to make it unplayable, the servers lags, the restrictions to F2P players are ridiculous, the market restrictions are far beyond stupidity (only 1 item listing, 30% tax reduction, 48h delay to collect the money) Now packs have come out and they are $30 usd per 1 month subscribtion + crap and no TP.So I do not recommend investing your money on this game, at least not for now"
TO be Honest this game will get alot of hate for the problems it has / had and that is  unavoidable. It was great fun while it lasted but to me the devs  couldve done things alot better and alot faster than they have. It was really fun and i dont regret putting time into it but its not something i would play long term. I put in at least 40 hours in the first week and thats because the game was fun. if youre looking for a game with a little bit of nostalgia then this is it but it wont hold your attention for long. 10 bucks wasnt worth it but the game is free now so why not give it a try. its not worth putting anymore time into just because it just doesnt feel like it should.
The real problem with this game is the lagness. I had a bugged quest that can't be continue no matter how many times i smash space bar. Skill points accumulated and cant be added leading to spamming lvl 2 earthquake all dei everydei.I'd recommend but it's better to wait out until the servers and connection issues are fixed.
"Pros: If you are looking for a game that succeeds Ragnarok Online, this game in many ways accomplishes it. It's got a awesome art style, works great with a controller. There's a lot of ease of access. Rarely do you need to consult a FAQ.Cons: Bots on the field, bots in town spamming. But can you talk in chat? Nope, gotta pay. So normally some players are spending $5 a month to endlessly annoy you. This results in ZERO community. Do a set number of quests per zone, fight a few boss monsters, rinse, repeat. Oh boy rinse repeat. This wouldn't be as bad if not for the required money grinding. You need a lot of silver to travel, repair armor; that breaks quickly, upgrading weapons, spells, even accessing your bank. I also don't recommend paying for this, as you are still limited. It's like they took this beatiful game and said, ""We want money, but we don't want to put any effort past 40% game developement.""Avoid it. The game is definitely got great gameplay for an MMO. But for how little it offers, for how they copy and paste each zone. It feels like they made 2 areas, then just recycled them over and over. It's astonishing how little support the game has, how little moderation against bots, and it's total lack of a community. This is a solo MMO. I instead recommend Tera, Diablo 3, or Dark Souls 1-3. Tree of Savior is purely driven on addiction."
Product received for freeLAG! I'm from SEA playing on SEA server. They don't have autokick for people who are idle so the server is congested. also full of bots and gold spammers. Stupid idiots!For those of you who are willing to put up with this like I am here's a tip!!!!!Definitely start in Klaipeda rather than Orsha!!!!I started one of my characters in Orsha and have been playing there for the past 20 hours. The two starting areas are severely unbalanced. Why would they do such a thing?!?! Stupid idiots!!Orsha is lacking so many things during the starting quests. You will find the following in Klaipeda but not in Orsha Starting Zone:- statutes that give you attibute points- some quests that give you movement speed potions- crafting recipes- battle cards!- lots of gems!- lv2 chestsNot to mention that teleport statue in Orsha is bugged and hard to click on.2) In Klaipeda you'll have quests that require you to use a compass. If you're lagging stand still after you use the compass and wait for a cooldown bar to appear to progress with the quest.
"I put a few hours into this game on early access.I'm going to make this short and address two main questions:1. The claim the developers made in that this is the successor to Ragnarok, is that true?2. Does this game retain value in how fun it is, in other words does the price in time/money show in fun you may have?1. Yes this is essentially what I recall Ragnarok Online being like, community aside you will always meet bad and nice people in mmos and the elitists are always going to be there but this game has everything RO suffered from with none of the things that really kept people with RO. It has bots and spammers but no amazing spells or abilities, nothing that makes your character feel unique/deadly/amazing it just feels like a horrible shadow of what RO was with regards to the few things that RO did right. The Music and Art are without a doubt RO in quality, the map design and exploration of each map is great... it just that your character wont feel like you are making any progress. You have so many classes fine but everyone of them are seeded with abilities that feel gimmicky as heck. I guess they wanted to add more player usage of controls in combat but this simply wasn't the right way to do it: it simply adds the attributes monotonous and cumbersome to what is a core part of the game... combat. 2. I would say no to this, if this was a buy to play build then yes it retains its value since you can get about 60 hours through the game before you are no longer interested in getting 100% completion on a map. Then yes this may even be a buy on steam sale type of game. However it's a cash shop kind of game which makes it harder to describe... so I'll split this into two parts.One - if you do use the cash shop then yes you essentially speed up your experience of what the game has to offer, it's nice to get you to the above mentioned 60 hours, at which point you've probably found yourself considering the value of the game and decided to shelf it for a while only to find you never return amid memories of noted bots, spammers, and most importantly gimmicky skills that didn't make you feel like a badass and made combat a chore. So yes the cash shop can be worth it if you want to experience more of the game before reaching the 60-80 hour range. You also get to look nice but again you may look unique but your abilities are sad perverted reflections of the ones RO offered.Two - I haven't spoken to anyone who kept playing past the 1st month, and I think like most of them I really wanted this game to be great, I didn't care if it was the next RO just that it was a great game. You do at the begining get a pretty nice thematic area of learn the game in. It in my opinion really pulls you in. It's later on things become bland and a grind fest. I was litterally only grinding to progress the story. I didn't care to make my character stronger, I didn't care about what abilities I got because they were all gimmicks. I knew how to play but you get level blocked by both which npcs are willing to talk to you based on your level and enemies that will 1 shot you if you aren't on their level.You start to notice how gimmicky your abilities are at higher levels more clearly when creatures become hp walls. You spend so much time doing ridiculous things to get your spells to do the most they can do before they fade away that it just gets old. I'm not sure what they were thinking of when they made some of these abilities. So no this isn't something worth my time at least is what I decided later on.In conclusion I can't recommend this game no matter how much I want to, maybe I can check it out in a few more months but there are some deep problems with the design choices on abilities anyway if you do get it enjoy. "
"This game has lots of potential like RO did.But...this game lacks hard working employees for the international side.If game developers dont live and love video games, then dont become a game developer.So they can go and hire better and more creative and skilled game developers.Honestly the blame is on whoever is managing the servers, networks and updates.Asian game companies used to do so great. Now they are doing so bad with sales and ceativity.It is almost as if they have no passion to create games anymore and become lazy.You guys need to listen to your customers. instead of being snotty.Look at these bad reviews world wide, and look at the numbers, They dont lie."
"Fun game at first, and its build and class systems are really nice. However, it is another case of ""wasted potential"" and there are too many problems and it becomes quite jarring. One such example is its party/queuing system. Horrendous, and one of many problems. "
"I've really loved this game the moment this got online on steam even though it constantly crashes and disconnects from server every few minutes. I just can't seem to recommend this to others even though i've loved the game. The game is just dying or dead already with so few players playing the game and maybe you can be friends with a lot of BOTS... and I mean ALOT OF BOTS!!  Many things just went south of this great game due to poor management... If you like grinding alone and with a lot of bots, be my guest. Adeu~"
"Besides playing early access, besides the grind and besides spending money and not regretting it, I can not recommend this game as of yet. Too many bugs and unbelievable laggy play. Sadly there isn't a neutral vote."
"Pros:If you like RO, then you'll like this game. Music is alright, not as great as people make it to be.Cons:Either too many monsters or totally empty. You end up fighting a lot just to do your quests.Unforgiving on builds, which defeats the purpose of 80+ classes. Too many spammers advertising fake websites on world chat.Not enough customization on characters. You can only choose your hairstyle, but not your hair color?! "
"This game is a Meh… It’s a theme park MMO. The graphics are good, the sound and music is ok. =x (but I like RO’s purely instrumentalist and classical taste.)The one thing that really kills it for me in this game is how many BUGS (Programming errors) there are. I have a pretty high end computer in my opinion… but that doesn’t matter since optimization is so horrible. So definitely don’t expect a smooth game play. Invisible skill tiles! This pretty much destroys one of the major mechanics of the game. After all if your life depends on finding these heal tiles I would imagine it NEEDS to work properly.Monster AI doesn’t really exist. They will walk through walls, over walls, over obstacles, even through you. That last one is kinda funny for giant bosses cause when they try to walk through you you get placed on top of their head. LOL.The bread and butter of MMORPG isn’t here. Player interactions are pretty minimal… 1. you don’t have to interact with another player really. Infact for quest, I find other players annoying. >_> 2. In my early games I tried to buy some things from another player and found out you can’t trade silver. 3. I had someone in team and a monster drops an item I don’t need and wanted to give to the other person… nope, doesn’t work because there is no Economy. Economy emerges from trades, and the system is pretty much against that. I hate stupid quest, but not quest in general. I would rather have quest be epic. Requiring teams to accomplish, and getting epic loot in the end. Here the quest pretty much just gives exp and leads you around. You can ignore the quest rewards  because it’s pretty much useless."
"Pros:Great graphics and art style.Music is amazing.Fun gameplay.Complex skill tree with huge number of classes to choose.Cons:Massive lags, Fps drops. The optimization in general is just lacking.Quests are very repetative.With all the classes that you can have, there is a very small amount of them that actually fit the meta for the end game.Gets boring quite fast when playing alone.Awful chat and communicaiton options."
"beautiful, absolutely beautiful. but very unfriendly for newbies, i was thrown the game with no hint of where to go.found the quest journal, asked me to talk the the a guy, fine, i talk to him, the quest still asks me to talk to him, and he doesn't respond. so fine, walked around somemore, talk to more random guys, i think they gave me a quest or something.but nothing shows up on the log, i kill mobs, items drops i try to pick it up, the character doesn't pick it up at all. pressing f3 i found my skills, i tried to add a few of my points in and press apply, nothing happens, the points don't register. what the hell?without any reason or quest log to look at what to do next, and not to mention unresponsiveness of the ui, i called it quits.pity, such a beautiful game. uninstalled."
"After 80 hours I just can't recommend this game.  When it isn't filled with broken NPCs/quests, it is just a grindfest.  I've gotten through what I understand to be 1/6 of my levels after 80 hours.  (I believe the cap is 600ish and I'm in the 100's)  It is the same repitition over and over.  The bots are horrendous, the spawn times, even after the buff, don't allow for the current amount of players in the map to progress.  The classes are underwhelming, especially if you stay within your ""Circle"".  Also, PVP is pretty much restricted to end game only.  The only PVP that I've even seen this game have is GvG.  I was excited, as the game has the same art style as Ragnarok Online did.  The gameplay, though, is a joke."
"Great game concept, great class idea's. Poor execution. Early access was for 1 month before going free to play. After going free to play, people didn't have access to buying ""tokens"" for what would be considered subscription access. Without this token the game makes it nearly impossible to do any type of trading with your own characters or other people. Let alone being behind a 30% xp curve. When they released the packages, that you can only buy once per account you get a 15 day token and tp to buy another 30 but beyond that nothing. Game had potenial but was wasted by a release that was not ready and a company who is money hungry. Oh yeah the servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥ lag constantly."
"This game is the poster child forAwesome but Impracticalhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpracticalThis game is a treasure of loveliness, not because it is ""kawai"" but because it is dreamlike; everything in graphics and musics and world and storyline invite to forgetting everyday life.As far as content goes, it is a tremendous success.And it is a bad game in the end because the devs can't get the technical part right, from the hitboxes of clickable items and characters to the very unstable servers, not even talking about jobs' balance more or less on perma-reshuffle (knowing jobs resets must be bought with cash...).The devs seem to be the artist type, good dreamers but bad doers, and as long as the game will be in such a state I can't advise to play it, it's simply too frustrating."
"Terrible game. Good anime graphics, but too much LAG, bugs and bad balance. End game totaly tedius, no Raids, and only players with higher income (real money or exploiters) can play properly. IMC is the worst company controlling the game and surely it will shutdown."
"Finally ToS is the game I wanted it to be.The state of this game at release was far from perfect. I had been anticipating it for a long time, and it was a huge disappointment. Here we had a game that had all the bases of the old-school ragnarok online, with a huge ammount of maps, an insane number of classes and the freedom to build your character at will. All of that trumped by the bizarre decission to make it a quest-fest game in which you did not explore maps, you just went from quest to quest and that's it.However, the most recent patch has finally achieved what i was hoping. I can finally create a character with my friends, make a party and explore maps searching for hunting spots while completely ignoring quests.I can finally recomend this game to anyone looking for that old style gameplay of just figuring where to lvl up on your own depending on the classes that your party has.Just a quick tip, ignore almost all the leveling guides you see, people keep blindly following guides that were released on the beta whcih are completely out of date and completely miss the point. Just get out there with some friends and explore."
I can't give a game a thumbs up because the game DOES.NOT.LET.ME.PLAY!   Tried everything to multiple redownloads to multiple repatches and it does not WORK!  A FAIL at the start deserves a WIPE from the harddrive.
"This game is truely heart breaking.  Such amazing potential, and yet it sits in the hands of a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥clowns.  Worst optimization I've ever seen. Punishing class and skill system (if you don't get it right the first time).  An item shop that makes you pay for crap that should be standard. (especially if you bought a founders pack)And above all, a blatent disreguard for it's fan base.  I hope this game either sinks into complete failure and disappears, gets handed over to Nexon so it can sink faster, or gets handed over to a team that can show the gaming community what this game was meant to be.  Annnnd I hope the developers of this heap of crap lose their jobs and never see work in the gaming industry again."
"IMC is by far the worst publisher. The game is full of bugs, RMTs, Hackers, the fps optimization is pretty lame and classes are so imbalanced that instead of having a good time playing you are always frustrated, on top of that the player base is really low and scattered between servers, so you are always waiting 20+ minutes in the party queue for entering daily dungeons. low level dungeons are never played unless you shout for people to join and that does not always work.  TL;DR don't play this game unless you are a masochist. "
"I kinda like playing this game.... BUT I CAN NOT Recommend this game to any new age mmo players.. Unless you like the old style of mmorpgs that have been out.. This game has potental But in its current state it wont shine.. There are alot of bugs glitches bots( gold spammers, Monster kill ).. and thus it is becoming more and more unstable to play the game honestly... Ill keep playing it though to see where it will lead.. I play on the EU server and i also regret to inform there is alot of SERVER LAGG due to all the bots and players.. Monster Respawn timers are really long and stupid to wait on ( i for one waited over 15-20 minutes for 2 rare spawns for a quest to appear ) Besides that note the game is quite fun just gotta be sure to get every and all quests that are in the area of your lvl and make sure to Eat the EXP Cards as they come great way to power level.. Hoarding them is sort of wasteful due to the fact if you get about 20-25 lvl creeps over your lvl you wont deal dmg at all to them.."
"This game have good ideas, but in it's current state its too much Pay2Win. You need to spend TP to increase storage, to get extra character slots, and even to respec. And ""free"" TP are capped at 5, what means that they cannot be saved and used for anything that cost more than 5TP. Moreover, all those spendings are going together with subscription tokens, and without them you are heavily gimped, even including lower movement speed."
"I dont need to say anything... read the other reviews.  Sadly, its everything true... Everything.I could be a very, VERY good game, but IMC is ruining it...  if it continues the way it is, it'll die, for sure. 2/10 not SMASHING"
"Impossible to play! The text is too small, making the entire game unreadable and unplayable. There's no way to change the UI size and the font size (the only font size that can be changed is in the chat, but that's not helpful since I can't read dialogue or quest text.)I tried many different screen resolutions and the text was still unreadable.No matter how 'pretty' a game may look, if it's unplayable for some people it's automatically bad!"

To other people, I'm more inclined to say no but you really have to try and not take my word for it (I understand this statement is a bit selfish). The game would have been really good if a lot of stuff got revamped and if there are more information released by the devs themselves. Since this game is often compared to another popular MMORPG, all I can say is this game is far behind between the two."
"I tried to give some time/patience to this game, i really did.I started in the pre-release at the server Klaipeda. The bot and gold sellers were always by our side.I didn't cared at all, and tried to enjoy the game even with ~200ms  (I live in Brazil), then, finally a server in South America arrived!In the very first day it was all great; No bots, no gold sellers and NO LAG!And then... Lag spikes and latency worse than Klaipeda.Suddenly some maps started to bug and we can't even unstuck our characters from there.I sent like 4~5 tickets to IMC begging to move out my character, and their response?We are aware of the situation, wait please :)Some people can't even log in their characters since May 5th until now (Almost two weeks)...I really give a point to IMC, they listen the community and work very hard in various aspects of the game,They answered my tickets very fast (at maximum 4 hours) and really try to ban all the cheaters/gold sellers from the game.Hell, they even give some compensation items when the servers goes in maintenance!But, in my oppinion, they are bad prepared. They didn't foreseen the huge success of the game (even with the Steam Greenlight event), didn't prepared themselves for the huge influx of players. That results in a game which: Are instable conection-wise, most of people can't even log in and can't be helped by the staff.It is a great game, and i really hope i can recommend it in a near future, but now, it's a waste of time. Saddly,"
"I personally have mixed opinions about the game.  1. Lack of unique customization - No hair color, limited choices on hair styles, no skin color, as far as I can tell your class determines your looks unless you purchase an outfit, armor doesn't change the look of your character so everyone loks the same other than class.2. Limitations - Starting the game I am going around grinding and grinding and grinding just to try to make a little silver cause you can't buy or sell on the marketplace for three days, you can't trade for three days, you can't do anything that's not relative to you vs. NPC.  It's too limited and I can't stand being limited.3. There is no option to purchase in game currency for Premium, another fail.If you're going to open up the game via Steam have everything ready... and don't limit the users willing to purchase your product and play your game... just the way I think.The game play is okay, lags a bit, but other than that it's okay I suppose, i've put a good bit of time into it and have a lot more to see."
"Product received for freeWas looking forward to this so much, but it's laggy even when nearing 200fps so I'm guessing it's server side. Some of the interaction with quest items take a few button presses for it to register.If using a controller, at the begining the bit where you have to use up down left right to see how the controls work only works with keyboard, so I had to switch to keyboard mode to get rid of that screen.Also, no resolution setting for fullscreen? Had to go into user.xml to change that..Also felt like my character kept getting weaker as I progressed, I chose cleric which understandably will have lower attack but still, it just felt like the attack did barely any damage even though I kept putting points in int which it said increases magic damage, the cooldowns on Heal and Cure were waay too long, they also heal too much considering you can set it to only heal and not damage. I'm not sure if you can use a range autoattack but my character would hit the rod instead of casting a ranged attack, I had to switch to shield and sword, on a healer to defeat a random side quest world boss thing....I don't understand how this is fun.And let's not forget the rmt spam bots.......... I found a mod that blocked and reported the spam which fixed the issue but the game devs can't even think of creating something similar or partnering with the mod creator.Maybe this game should've stayed in beta a bit more, it's not exactly playable to me as it is."
"Game is good and has potential in long run but for now this should be still in beta. Dev cannot handle the game. Too many bugs. Only one admin is answering or concern on the forum but they say the staff got fired for replying too much for the players. So yeah no more communication from players to Devs.If you wanna waste time play this, if you want to have dungeon runs(Commander and Exceed limit) and quest and if you wanna compete with the BOTs and silver buyers in market and its really happening.You have 4 character slots and your pet consumes one slot for it. Have many classes and you can mess up your skills or class combination in the long run but you already purchase expensive cosmetics( You cannot delete character if you purchase a premium item on it so be careful and You cannot transfer between your characters this premium items**hair, premium consumables, stat/skill reset, dungeon resets. exp tome.)Most of the time you hunt items or materials for the equipment you like but there are BOTs that you can see every map and its getting your materials. So yeah you wont get it unless you but it from Market which is most of the time overpriced and controlled by boss hunters. They list the names of BOTs in the forum but I dont see the one i report because its still there. What I think is they just write names just to say they ""ban"" something or they dont ban just suspension of account?.Server is lag most of the time. Your animation is delayed and talking to npc is horrible when questing. They seem cannot fix it even they said ""they transfer the server already"" which makes it worse. Every tuesday they get 5 hrs maintenance but nothing seem to optimize and still get worse. If your archer you cannot auto atk on this. I will leave it for now."
***UPDATE 6/30/2016 - They implemented TP purchasing but it costs you double if you live in Europe or North America.  If you live in Southeast Asia or South America you pay half as much.  Total BS and I won't be spending a cent on this game until they equalize TP purchases for all players!Original Post:If you're trying it free-to-play be ready for disappointment.  The developers in their infinite wisdom made it pay-to-win by disabling most BASIC mmo functions for the free player.  These are some of the notable downsides:1. Can't trade with other players2. Can't buy premium items (they won't even allow you to buy TP currency with real money yet!)3. Can only have 1 item on the marketplace at a time4. Takes 30 min - 2 hours for market item to show up on the market5. Takes 48 hours to retrieve money from a marketplace sale6. 30% marketplace commission screws your ability to profit or even trade items with friends via marketplace effectivelyI'm sure there will be a lot more downsides like the many bugs that are still present and the idiotic AoE Ratio stat (your AoE skills won't hit everything in range because they cap how many mobs you can hit depending on the AoE Ratio of the ability...nothing like slamming Earthquake down on 12 monsters and hitting 5 of them while the other 7 punch you in the face).Lots of potential since the art and music is great but at this point I'd rather go back to RO 1 than deal with this currently gimped game.
"I really tried to like it... I swear but in the end everyone got IMCed...  This game could be described as materialized disappointment, never the hipe have been so mislead, overall the core idea of the game is awesome but it NEEDED way more work to polish and sort everything straight or maybe it would never a complete overhaul since the graphic engine runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥and the  game doesnt make use of multicore CPUs so we end up getting HORRENDOUS OPTMIZATION plus their net code is also bad.  All in all this game needed more time before launch or even to be redone like FFXIV but probaly not gonna happen since IMC is not a giant as Square Enix.I still play it casually sometimes but I won't recommend it as it is right now, infested with bots more than 70% of the original population quited because the servers run like♥♥♥♥♥♥and the terrible support IMc has been giving to iTOS, the japanese server seens to run alright I hope someday the international TOS get the same treatment as jTOS,  considering iTOS at the moment of this review I would not recommend it, but feel free to check it if you want if you are a fan of korean grinding machines leveling system with cute anime like 2D sprite characters( prob the only reason everyone is playing lol)."
"Lag simulator, slow reaction from developers. Its♥♥♥♥♥♥♥lag for a whole week and they do nothing. Reply ticket with auto form sh!t. Turn into slide show when there are 5 more people in the map. Don't even know how to balance their game."
"Tree of Savior is a great MMORPG which can suck you in for hours on end. It is great to finally have an MMO to pour my hours into again after years of subpar MMOs. The game does have some glaring issues that need to be addressed and I hope overtime these can be remedied. Overall, the game is still fun to play.For my full thoughts, see my review: http://www.onrpg.com/news/editorial/tree-of-savior-review-the-online-single-player-game/ "
"As many have indicated, I bought the founder's pack for this game. I was quite excited and hyped to see another RO2 like game. However, after only 6 hours into this game, I decided to uninstall, why?-tons of lag spikes and lag, almost unplayable in towns-tons of bots and hackers-boring and repetitive quests-very bad navigation-developers don't care about fixing bugs, but are more focused on emptying your wallets by adding more cash items and dlcs"
"Its almost like solo game, most of the content you can do solo, you have mp/hp pots thats why 90% noone makes party to do anything together except dungeons. I find that so boring cos in mmo most important thing is playing in group and in this game - there is no trinity, noone rly needs you, you can buy buffs in town and ggthis would be rly rly good game if more party oriented cos solo just gets boring fast!!"
"I don't believe this, an MMO being this buggy is utter horsemanure. Imagine this, in my few hours of playing I had to create 8 different characters in 3 of the servers just to try and progress the quest. Why you ask? Because apparently, unlike other MMOs where the worst bug/glitch that could happen is crash to desktop, Tree of Savior being the highly innovative and ground breaking MMO that it is, makes your chars get stuck in perpetual limbo. I'm serious. Playing your guy, enter a MAIN CLASS TRAINER home for A MAIN STORY QUEST, gets kicked to the server list with a error message showing up for a fraction of a second and then BAM! that character cannot be played again. Yup.Only ways to fix it is..raise a ticket in their support and wait for something to happen. After a day, they responded that they moved my first char to starting city. Ok good, skipped the quest (which again I mention, is a MAIN QUEST) and entered the next map on the list AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN. Raised a ticket, made other several chars, same issue. Go to map, get slapped with error and then char becomes unplayable. I have 8 different characters in 3 different servers stuck in various dimensions of purgatory and I'm at a loss. It's seldom an MMO is this badly made. Sure, MMOs get grindy or boring or hit a pay to win wall..... But for an MMO to be an unplayable mess is quite something else.Such a shame though, as a guy whose first MMO was Ragnarok Online, I was really excited to play its spiritual successor. The stat building is more than just pumping your main attack stat. The class system is so varied and deep that you can make so many unique combos...(only few ones are viable endgame though but oh well). And the art style is the most beautiful I have seen seen in an MMO, retaining anime qualities and yet a bit of classy old school look.For its faults. this coulda been an imperfect masterpiece even with maybe a few crashes, but this is something that cannot be bypassed, overlooked or forgiven. Do yourself a favor and stick to the other mindless mmos, sure it might be braindead but at least you can play em."
"I LOVE THIS GAME the art is studding,sound track amazing  story its good not bad but its good  and would i reccomemd it yes i would highly reccomend this game forcthe art and sountrack "
"I have 180+ hours of play in this game.As you can see in many other reviews:- The Game is Good.- The publisher (IMC) is trying to do their best (I guess) but they're not accomplishing.- We've been playing for 2 months, and a few thing are getting fixed.- This game has a lot of potential, I hope someday I could thumbs up this review."
"I'm sorry, but this game is ridiculously managed, showing little promise to improve or fix the many MANY issues plaguing it.  Months after launch, even some of the most glaring problems remain.It should've been the biggest red flag in the world when IMC announced an open beta, encouraged everyone to get hyped & tell everyone they know, then when time came, they threw the beta out the window and went straight to a ""founders server"" format.  But we played anyway, and things just kept getting worse.The biggest technical problem this game faces is that it's programmed with zero understanding that your processor may have more than a single core.  So a machine that surely should be able to handle this game may behave like a toaster, while a toaster may actually perform better.  The problem has been pointed out as a high priority issue since the first closed beta.  It continued to exist in the second beta.  It continued at launch.  It continued when they introduced pvp modes such as guild battles and team battle league.  IT'S STILL A PROBLEM NOW AND THEY WON'T FIX IT, EVER.  So enjoy having 2 fps in any situation with a large number of players on screen.But don't try to blame it on a lack of funding.  Like the majority of Korean MMOs, they already got Gacha out the door.  Aaaaaaand the content is awful.  How awful?  They took things you could originally just buy with their premium currency, and tied it to this gambling content.  Yeah, that happened.Oh yeah, did I mention the bots?  There's bots.  Lots of bots.  Everywhere.  Can't walk through town without a bunch spamming the chat, even whispering you personally to visit their real-money-trade websites.  Can't go through any area with high mob density (which was supposed to help you get exp) without bots just ruining that.  I get it.  They're made faster than they can be banned, but it doesn't even look like they try to do THAT anymore.  Hell, even in high level areas, you will find people with names that aren't skgjbnu or something like that botting.  Yeah.  IMC doesn't care if you cheat.  If they end up creating a new beneficial bug or exploit, you might think you shouldn't touch it, since that's wrong & might get you punished.  No worries, they never have and never will do something like that, as incident after incident have proven.  So cheaters will just reap the benefits and enjoy them forever, even after said exploit is fixed (if IMC ever actually gets around to it).  That just sounds like a wonderful MMO to join, huh?I could also go into the boggling world that is the adjustments that IMC made to the various classes in this game (which you're stuck with after you've made your decisions), but I could write a book about that.  Oh, did you sacrifice your offensive options and go with a purely defensive class for several ranks?  Well, IMC will decide those defenses shouldn't actually work because screw you.  Oh, is your class incredibly good at pvp?  Well good news, IMC is giving you a buff!  Yeah... enjoy figuring out what you want to play, only to have it trampled after the fact.This game stopped being fun.  It barely works.  The only thing that seems to keep people coming back is a sunken time fallacy.  The sad part is that I'm one of them."
"""The ipf. files are damaged the client will now shut down""its been a year since I played this game all because of this stupid error.please  help.I cant find a solution online that actually works.Im not sure if theres official instructions for this somewhere, but if so, please give me a link.I have had enough of this error "
"Go pick up a better-managed game. This game is getting dry.So many unresolved bugs that have lasted for more than a year, literally zero communication from IMC regarding important matters, they just duck their heads when everything goes wrong. They even gave out the current best weapons in the game to a bunch of exploiters and abusers for being the best at bullying other players.Once you've reached max level, there's really nothing to do anymore. Most people have stopped doing current ""endgame"" (ET) since they're already done, they find it boring (hours of running the same thing every day), or they can't commit to a dedicated party to do it with (which is terrible btw). Everyone's just waiting for new content, and even then, if the bugs still persist, the players won't really last long as there is still no end game in sight.PvP is dry because of the lack of balance among classes and the stupid overpowered transcendence system. Also nobody really likes the fact that there's no 24/7 PvP arena or map. There are guilds but it's mostly a social thing, as they have nothing to do but PvE stuff since IMC removed GvG.People can't even play tree of fashion since new costumes you would want are locked inside gacha, obviously wanting you to spend more than you should, as opposed to the korean TOS counter-part wherein they get new costumes in packages or direct buy with TP (IMC's premium currency).If you're new and are piqued at the art and unique class system of the game, then go ahead and try it out. It's a pretty okay game at that if you can ignore everything else that's wrong in the game. If you're looking into getting a bit serious towards a game (i.e spending money or thousands of hours), better look for a different game. This sht ain't worth your time nor money."
"loved it at first, then i realized how grindy and boring it can become, if you dont like sitting there for long periods just to go up one lvl, this is not for you. and it had so much potential too........"
"Tree Of Saviour is a FREE MMORPG with a unique artstyle, loads of content, something like 80 classes, over the top (diablo style) combat animations, proper buff/debuff rotations, and built in full controller support.All games should follow this model, make something so good that people want to spend money on it.10/10."
"I enjoyed the game before but not that much, now I literally just uninstalled the game, before I could do the dungeons and most of the stuff by myself, now I cant grind at all because suddenly after the Rework either the mobs do way more dmg or Im weaker, anyways. enough of this. Uninstalled."
You seem to be able to personalize your class. If you like getting achievements this is the game for you. Catching up at the start is pretty easy thanks to the constant boosts and event for novice players.
"It was fun while it lasted. The once populated SEA servers have been merged due to low user count. Nowadays, you can see ppl shouting for dungeon party in public chat. It is a stark contrast to the game when everyone was queuing for a spot."
"Have more than 1k hours in korean ToS.People complain about the company but have yet to realize it could be worse, for ex : nexon.It's a good game with good amount of classes and the optimization isn't bad either. "
"Interesting gameplay and overall polished experience, but the amount of big-breasted anime girls for 14 year olds is way too high to take any part of its story and world building seriously. I'll probably play this one on and off when I want to have the old ragnarok grinding experience, but this game hasn't much depth, so beware. It also doesn't shy away from rubbing the paid options right in your face, so expect hitting a button and it'll say ""this is only for our premium players!""."
"Just like any other MMO, wait a month or so. Server status is not good, and game play is super laggy.Dont spend any cash on this game, just come and play it for free and wait until about June, when all the hype dies down."
"Servers are crap currently, prepare to always deal with a login que. Along with lag once you do get logged into the game.You'd think with all the people paying to play this game, there would at least be decent servers. Sadly, there isn't a whole lot going for this game at the moment unless you are a fan of bots. Tons of those around..."
"Not gonna say much... What got my interest in this game was the art style and the liberty of the class system. It had potencial. I played for like 8 hours and you might think thats nothing but in so little time I got very disappointed. I agree with the majority of negative things people are saying in the reviews: The interation with other playes is scarce, the class system isnt well developed, its very linear, the story seems really nice at first but it doesnt progress in a interesting way... The game tries to fool you but you can quickly see its flaws. I know this is free to play and all, but Eden Eternal did a much better job with a cute style, a wide class system, etc, wich is a game that I played a lot and loved it. Tree of Savior is disappointing in a way that I don't wanna play any second more. A real shame. =/ (Going back to FFXIV! <3)"
"Don't waste your money buying the founder pack.Pro - 1. Art! That's all....2. Music! Some of the music are really great and awesome. While a few of them are like dance/disco? music that completely destroy the atmosphere (Overall is good, but some just doesn't fit to the atmosphere)Con - 1. Game play is extremely repetitive, boring story, boring quests that make grinding even worse2. Lag Lag Lag - 80% of the time3. Server down - So far since released, the server that I played will go down for at least 1 time per day4. CommanderLoadFail (for 2 days I can't play with my main character and the publisher didn't even post anything about such issue. I guess they all off for weekend wtf....)5. Gold spammer! I never see a game with so many gold spammers! My block list are super long (100+)6. Bots! GM either blind or they are sleeping...7. P2W and its super expensive too... Ex. $9.00 for 100 TP, reset skill potion cost over 150 TPtheres more but this should be enough.... "
Could have been an amazing new game but it went straight for the same things that made Ragnarok suck towards the end of its life. P2W premium services is too much money for them to avoid a second time I guess.
"I'm writting this review to tell you the 6.0 hrs on my record on it, is nothing but a lie. Let me explain..The game is supposedly open on the 28th of this month/last month, so i downloaded the game so i won't have to deal with downloading it later. Patiently waitted for the opening on the 28th of April, and April 28th came and gone and it's still not open for people to join. Now the 6.0 hrs i got is from loading the game, cause it had this half cut percentage meter below. God knows why its done so poorly but whatever. And i checked if i can get in, but to no avail, you still need to buy the Founder Packs to get in. When it was stated that it was going to be open on the 28th, sure. Whoever from sources they told me it was delayed till next month, now from what i recall and know. I could be wrong or totaly right. They might pull a longer release delay just so people will buy more Founder Packs, and deprive the other people that cant afford a Pack to get in the game. Ive seen a few games pull this before, dangling the carrot on a piece of string to a person chainned and blindfolded. And the carrot at a reach enough for you to touch it with the tip of your tongue, but far enough that you cant eat it till the chains pull you back. If the developers of this game, put another arbitrary delay again. This game is destined to be a Pay 2 Get Inside system, saying ""uhhh were suppose to release this week, but were gonna delay it till next week cause reasons.."" then delay the release further, cause why not? People will buy Founder Packs to get in the game, lets milk this till dust comes out of the udders of the cows.Overall the game gets a stunning 2/10 till i can get inside the game itself, i will not retract this review. If you can call it a review at all, waitted hand and foot to get inside to give it a good review. But they can't be arsed to release on time and promise, my review will be half arsed like they are.PS. They should remove the Release Date notice, and change it to ""Pleaze Buy More Founder Packz!!!!"" Just fitting, seeing how blatant they are in lying on the Release Date.UPDATE: So they moved the release date to May 10th, cause their adding servers some says. And or applied something to the game that warrants a push back. Details are skethcy at best, no unified answer to why they really pushed back the release date to 12 days from the original release date. Will dig into this whole deal deeper, to find out the real reason for the push back release date.Apparently hackers is part of the reason, people that refund for the Founders Packs and people thats in Russia and Brazil? Wtf seriously? Anyways, ive read that they were doing vague stuff on the server dev side. https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=378 direct link to their post on their website, to make things clearer. Will post more after the game releases, maybe not. Cause theres a 50/50 chance that they might delay the game again to the near end of May or next June. Lets all see what their move will be."
"Something about this game just feels.. lacking. It's not bad per se, but this is probably the fastest I got burned out from playing an MMO. What.. around 1 week?It's marketed as a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online, but I really don't feel the resemblance besides being 2.5D and having somewhat similar art.From a technical standpoint, the game is somewhat poorly optimized and starts lagging considerably at around 10+ players on-screen, dropping to a janky 40 fps for a medium setup like mine. For reference, I can run something like The Witcher 3 on max settings at around the same framerate. For a 2.5D game, this is very concerning.Gameplay-wise, I don't think it even captures the charm that RO had in its time. The overworld there was huge and exploration was fun... plenty of towns and dungeons to explore in no particular order. Here you've got like 2 towns and levelling is as linear as it gets. Go to this map.. level up a bit and do some quests.. now go to this conveniently adjacent map.. level up some more.. rinse and repeat. As for the quests, whereas RO's quests were hidden and scattered like easter eggs with interesting rewards, the quests here are a dime a dozen and either just kill, fetch, or click quests for some amount of XP and disposable gear.I won't even get into the player trading, auction house, and botting.. a lot of people already have those covered. Who knows.. maybe it all gets better in the late game. Regardless, the journey to get there sure is boring as hell though."
"Product received for freeThis game is runned by IMC. I brought DLC pack and now, my friends who wait for F2P must go to another new server.Trade system is terrible.So ****ing lag.CommanderLoadfail.Bot, goldseller is everywhere.Token, haha.I buy DLC pack just because my childhood game, Ragnarok Online, but it just make me disappointed.Tree of Soloplay, Token of Savior."
"It's really an amazing RO-like game for the first 100 or 200 hours. But it goes extremely boring in end-game pve part: poor balance between pve builds and nearly no interactive content. PVP is just mediocre. To sum up,  RO is still better than TOS in everything except part of gfx."
"The game is plagued with server/latency issues; you will lag, no matter where you are, how great your computer is, you will lag and it will suck.Trading is locked within the game and you need special items to be able to do so. These items can only be unlocked by buying them within the itemshop.When selling items, you will not be able to aquire your gold until 2 days after the sale. The game is fun initially but quickly gets incredibly repetative. You grind, kill a boss, go on a quest, repeat. Pvp is stale and pve requires little team work; most of the game can be done solo as a healer. The game really suffers from a lack of character customization. You will all look the same, have the same hair, eyes and outfits for about 95% of the game. Simply my opinion but I reached level 200 and could not find a reason to log on any longer."
"Boring combat.Completely unchallenging gameplay.Worst AI in a game, that I've played in awhile.Riddled with bugs.Questing/EXP cards are the primary way to level unless you want to spend countless hours grinding and there is are not enough quests to continuously progress you through the game.Class balancing is awful.Unforgiving class/stat selection.Too many basic features are blocked by a paywall. ( Trade, Auction House ect )Cash shop prices are inconsistent and unfair for the exact same content.  Example Male hairstyles cost 119TP while females are 178TP. You basically are charged more to play a female and no other reason.This game had a lot of potential, but IMC is quickly ruining this game with poor decision making. "
"Right now, this is one of the most addictive games/rpg's I have played in recent years.It has so much potential and I'm loving it, however this game is MASSIVE, the map is just unreal, boggles the mind.....A quick word about the Devs, they are fast to react, and are dealing with any issues asap, so hats off to them.Since the game has so much content, I am yet to see the first dungeon which is lvl 50+, but I will soon.This game is all about coming up with new builds, lvling up and testing them out, progression and trying to come up with the new ""best idea"" that others have not tried yet....Just sitting with a skills/class calculator for a couple hours is so much damn fun....For now, this game comes highly recommended, I will update this review later when I have had the chance to see further content."
"It was a fun game, untilI  keep getting  ""we've updated the launcher. please try running the client again.""Follow by Failed to start game(app already running).Updated MFC (follow by Korean words) keep showing up in the task manager,which prevents Steam to shutdown.tried different ways to launch the game, reinstall steam, backup the game data, redownloaded & reinstalled the game still not working.This is the first game so badly patched, never encounter this kind of problem.These are very annoying, wasting money."
"IMC keep changing whatever they like and give empty promises. SERIOUSLY DISSAPOINTED. Raised price a day before discount.Says it's to eliminate bots and gold seller - still full of bots and gold seller.Say 30% discount, 100% hike instead.WHAT YOU GOING TO DO WHEN IT'S IN F2P? WHEN BOTS ROAM THE GAME AND PLAYER LEAVING AFTER FEW MONTH OF HYPE TEST?Wish you all the best IMC, and you've dissapointed a lot of player. Probably only people from US side will continue to support as the price is affortable for them. For those in low pay country background...they'd probably have to just play free all the way if they desire so."
"In its current state, I can't recommend the game to anyone. If you're going to play this game, be aware that you will probably run into a lot of issues. While the base foundation is there, the game is simply not ready for public access. Tree of Savior has one of the most over the top trade restriction that are built to combat gold sellers but wound up punishing its playerbase instead. Due to this games' low spawn rate and mob reward system, you're going to run into a fair amount of killstealing where you won't get quest progress or credit if you don't last hit a mob. Shout chat is still filled with gold seller shouts, and bots are running around freely in unpopulated and populated areas (granted, what free to play mmo doesn't have bots doing just that). There have been exploits, dungeon entry issues, server and channel entry issues, glitches and a lack of optimization that makes you question if IMC just wanted to push this out to make as much money as they can before it dies out.I've also written a more detailed review and overview which you can visit by heading to the website below:http://freetoplayreview.com/tree-of-savior-review "
"After 1 month , the server is still laggy piece of garbage and they have no way of fixing it.Taking 10 sec to charge multishot is so fun! Your character also get stuck when you are using a skill. Umbo blow also takes forever to spin.Plays well when the server is not overloaded.Soundtrack is great , artwork is great."
"Hi guys! since this is my first review I wanted to be as honest as possible.I'm still playing btw comments are appreciated! :DI don't really recommend this game FOR NOW but if IMC will improve this game is really recommended.Now let's START! Tree of Savior(abbreviated as TOS thereafter) is an MMORPG in which you embark on a journey to search for the goddesses in the world of chaos. Fairy-tale like colors accompanied with beautiful graphics in TOS will have you reminiscing about precious moments all throughout the game. PROS:-Good Animu style-Good BGM music-80 Classes of characters (4 Mainly)CONS:-Trade Restriction-Bots-Discrimanation-Grinding( I really hate Grinding :0)-Quest Based? ( Well in early levels)-FPS ( even with nice spec it still drops to 20)-Bugs, Tons of Bugs -OP Classes (such as wiz, cant block magic or evade)Hope this helps and I really hope that IMC and TOS will improve in the near future. (sorry for bad grammar  :D)"
"Although the combat is fun and the class system is unique and interesting, the game does all it can to force you into paying for over priced cash shop options by limiting basic MMO features drasticly. I would definitely describe it as pay to win."
"Great game with a lot of problems.Cons:1. Too much bot, when you go to the main town you got spammed per an army of bots, when you look the global chat you always see an announce for RMT.2. The game got over limited, you can only do 2 dungeons per day instead of 5 run PER dungeons at the beta. If you are a F2P player, you can't use some feature, example the party storage.3. You crash/Lag without reason due to the fact that the code is poorly optimized, one of the worst optimization that I've ever seen.4. You can't really trade see: https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=356One of the reasons for these limitations is normally to prevent BOT, but this isn't effective at all, the only good point for IMC is to make you cash all month for an useless token for using all the feature of the game.Pro:1. Great class, you can make ""your"" proper class. The current system of job is very good in this aspect.2. The Dungeon/Instance are good but too limited see #2 of Cons.3. Nice soundtrack & design"
"its a good game if you like to play ragnarok online you will love this game..if you can deal with the lag issues on the server and the long wait entering a server. lag kills the fun in the game. maybe if they upgrade their servers, ill play again gameplay. art. mechanics are good thou. lag just kills the fun."
"The game is not ready, it's still a lot of work to do do with it, quests, lag. market, exploits, etc. The game is beautiful and fun on the firsts lvls but when you reach lvl 50 is better to go alone on the dungeons because you get more xperience, which I found particulary weird for an mmo. You can enter to the dungeon finder ONLY if you are alone, meaning if you are leveling with a friend you can't enter at the same queue to fill your party...Other thing very stupid, you have a TP market BUT you can't buy TP points... WTF!!!"
"PROS :> Very good soundtracks / BGM> Playing through art (very beautiful artstyle)> ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of classes and build choices> Not P2W heavy (Those that says otherwise aren't really thinking and calculating)> Intuitive drop system (DPK) (Some hates it, but : git gud)> Nice questing system (esp. if you have addons)> Good collection systemCONS :> Gets grindy and boring after a while. (But I find myself keeps getting hooked to play again, especially if you have friends)> Bugs (minor - not enough to break the whole game)> Cute/Chibi style may be a turn off for some> OP wizards in PvP> Daily dungeon limit (although dungeon reset scrolls are available for purchase)> People ranting and whining about the game releasing a 'p2w' cube and hard to get items for hidden class advancement (git gud)Recommended for those interested."
"This game is pretty much a jokeNot populated, and they keep cutting down channelsHorrible ping causes game breaking auto crafting bug (Yes, I'm playing fletcher)450ms for NA server in AU, am I connected to Africa?Most of the comestics are from rng box, and it's badCheck their website for patch note, pretty much nothing worth mentioningIt feels like dev are running a dead game on potato as a cash grab and nothing else "
"fps suckalot bot ingame and u still can see it after 1 month when u reported that mean GM not working in this game (they suck, they just take money and auto rep your post like a bot) TREE OF BUG, TREE OF BOTS, TREE OF AFK, TREE OF F*CK UR TIME"
"The servers have not been stable for this game since launch. They fixed almost nothing from the closed beta tests.This is an amazing game, me and my group enjoy it a lot. The company running it however is not.They don't listen to any of our concerns, they have no PR management. Slowly running the game into the ground.You can't trade unless you pay 18$/month and then you're limited to 30 trades TOTAL between you and someone else who has a token (service).They knew how many people were going to play this game, atleast a good number. Yet they only had 2 servers, and have added 2 more with bad transfering rules. The servers crashed constantly, even though it was a problem in cbt. They spent as little as they could and this is the result. If you already opened your benefit package for pre-ordering you cannot transfer those items to the new server on a new character. Any existing characters cant be transfered for atleast 1-2 months.The last closed beta tests had things missing from them that the Korean beta tests had. No pvp implemented STILL, poor translation, glitchy bosses. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, the testing was for nothing. The testing atleast let us trade, allowed us to market itemsON TOP OF ALL THAT, the no trading system is there to stop bots. Yet theres 100's of bots spamming the global chat constantly with no signs of bans or anything being done.My character is now lost with an error ""commander load fail"" for the past 12 hours on a weekend. No staff on the weekend of a LAUNCH. Even on the weekdays we get no replies from any mods on the forums. The market crashed and tons of people lost their rare drops they were selling, with no compensation from IMC except for 2x exp scrolls. That's all we get for all this downtime, and we can't even use them.The cash shop prices are ridiculous, female cosmetics cost 2x the price of male cosmetics for a 2.5d game. Enhancements are p2w, tokens are 18$, hairs cost 10-18$.I do not recommend this game until they start getting their act together.All they would have to do is saying things will change, give us updates, TALK TO THE CONSUMER.This game may as well be run by nexon. 0/10 company 10/10 game."
"I was caught by the beauty of the graphics and the sound of this MMO.I know I could not expect much, I am an ultima online veteran fan and definitely I feel better with sandbox styles MMO. But I wanted to give it a try.Maybe it's just me, but all the modern MMO's I play looks to me exactly the same. Just different Gfx and combat mechanics, but for the rest is copy/paste. Usual quests-hub based progression, story not epic nor gripping, most players just grinding or in hurry to reach edngame for whatever reason. No real ""mmo"" feeling, looks like just an instanced multiplayer game with grouping possibilities. But that's fine, those are modern MMOs. Not for me, and I cannot reccomend it because it's just boring. Bosses are cool at the beginning, but then they look all the same. No basic options like trading between players. F2P + Cash Shop + ""Subscription"" word hidden from this ""Token"".Could become interesting/better at Endgame as some other players said..but why should i force myself to grind to death and get money-milkey until I can START liking a game? A good MMO can be enjoyed from the first minutes of gameplay. "
"I've been to RO1, RO2 and was hoping to get a better experience in this game. I bought the Founders Blah Blah, to be able to play this game, hoping to get much from what I paid. At first, it was fun, coz I am playing with my bro. I didn't mind all its faults thinking that the game will get better and better soon. I suffer from very low FPS, though I have a unit with high specs -higher than the recommended, I suffer from delays and lags in dugeons though I have an excellent connection. I've been into a lot of MMOs, and they all run smooth, except for TOS. I just can't understand why. I am not a techie person, and I don't know anything about optimization and the like, but through reading reviews, I came up with a realization that this game has not leveled with the fun and enjoyment I experienced playing in RO1. That is why, my plans to recommend this game to my friends would remain an elusive dream forever. I still play though, at least a couple of hours in a day, farming for arde dagger, and doing the 3/3 mercenary quest. But to explore the game more? I doubt if I'd still have the interest. I am just waiting for my token to expire, then, I don't know what will happen next. It killed my interest in playing with other MMOs, this game made me tired and unhappy...#peaceout"

"Bought the DLC pack, total waste of money. The game is currently unplayable at its state. Lots of potential, but I just can't find the drive to play the game anymore. It requires you to play 5-6 ranks of classes you don't want until you hit rank 6 or 7. And it totally sucks up a huge amount of effort and time. Good game, was totally hyped before release. But totally different when you play it. Should've bought CS:GO. ToS, total waste of money."
"This game has heavily suffered from the growing pains experienced b all MMOs (even WoW, how quickly people forget) but still remains the most engaging one I've played in a decade. It's unfinished, very messy, but getting better month by month and full of oddly charming ideas.If you need customer-oriented polish and the Disney theme park MMO experience (WoW and its offspring) then back away because you will find the game super disappointing. (And remember, if you're an American, that this is a Korean game so you won't get the same preferential treatment that other games have given your locality)If you're looking to grow your experience with games, don't mind doing research in order to be effective, or are fascinated by the kind of failure that only happens when something reaches too high -- definitely give it a chance."
"This is a isometric mmorpg.Hello unnamed person from an unnamed team. Thanks for saving alot of people after the great chaos that came after ....The music is really good, the npcs are good, there aren't too many side quests (in my opinion), you have alot of sub-classes for your main classes and the max level is really high so you got alot of grinding to do.You can only pick between male or female of the 4 starting classes, no dungeons untill level 50, you need to make an account on another page for this game, people seem mostly afk or unwilling to talk to anyone new and the cleric feels underpowered vs flying/floating enemys.No steam acheivements or cards.So if you like an isometric mmorpg that is free, with only humans to pick, 4 begining classes that can learn alot of sub-classes, with really good music, good npcs and a underpowered healer then this might be the game for you.Have fun, enjoy and your Rose is in another castle :)"
"This guy,""Endurance"", said everything:""I have a level 230 Shinobi, and a Pardoner/Buffer thats aiming to become an Oracle someday.. i'll give you my thoughts about this game:Tree of Savior is being runned by a publisher called IMCIMC made some pretty dumb decisions on how to handle RMT & Gold Farmers, they've put restrictions on almost everything, while RMT are still trading talt to their buyers and those players sell it to npc for 5k each, every other legit suffers from marketplace queues and trade restrictionsThe game is very poorly optimized even on high end PC's.. its funny because there was no performance issues during iCBT.. this all started to happen after they do a maintenence and it gets worst everytime they do itWe've got a few elitist f&%kers camping Dullahan and other popular world bosses to farm cubes, yes just a party of 6 ~ 12 people and they pretty much own the market, things that people want to buy are not listed on the marketplace and nobody is selling because they aim on inflating everything via high demand.. which seems to be working very well for themThere are many cool community made addons that wasnt officially approved by IMC yet, and TOS is a VAC enabled game.. lately i've been seeing top 10 players disappearing from the rankings and nobody knows whyDungeons are always bugged, either theres a problem queueing due to a large influx of players doing the same thing, you would get booted to the login screen over and over until you finally get in, IMC have given some decent compensation for it over the past few weeks, but after the recent 24 hour (yes one full day) maintenence, nobody has recieved compensation at all!I'm not new to the MMO scene, I played pretty much every game out there for nearly two decades.. One of my favorite things about it is the International community, everyone speaks different languages, everyone has a different grind, a different strategy on doing things.. Tree of Savior has the most toxic, most racist playerbase i've ever seen!They pretty much runned the Brazilian players off the server! Some are to blame for recent exploiting, but others were really nice.. anyway they're all gone now. IMC moved them to a different server and there goes 1/3 of my friends list, the few that are left are being automatically blocked due to some bug after the previous maintenence, so I currently have nomore friends.I'm writing this here because I wanted to write about it at the forums, but I'm constantly getting 404 errors or the forums would not load at all.. yeah i'm getting tired of this game and it hasn't even fully launched yetAlready bought the expansion to Guild Wars II and thats where i'm going.So to anybody thats waiting on this game, or dying to play it.. don't get your hopes up its gonna be a big waste of time and disappointment, no doubt the game will be overrun by gold spammers and botters once its F2P"""
"Played this gime for a bit.. Gave it all i have got to 330 and 350 on 2 characters got lucky got some and the game was really fun.In short.. as everyone here previously sayed - great story, great graphics, fun, many awesome classes(that is what kept me going).Sadly there are too many gold(silver in this case) sellers.. for real cash and bots around. Nobody gets banned for taht so you never know who at endgame actually uses them to get their items and im more than sure many do even people who play from start.. The game as you have read is pruely RNG.. You can kepe failing enchanting item and when it loses potential you are screwed.. the main item you strive for is your weapon, doesn't matter what armor, just weapon is all it matters. When you get it to good weapon you can fail its gems(which are important) and if you fail, bam its gone you wont see it.. But if you get it to 0 potential before its +14 or +16 its also kinda pointless.. you can keep it till you get a better one i guess. But it's really too much RNG, I would advice you to try it out , it really is great, but due to big RNG, and uncontrollable God Sellers and plenty of players who most likely buy some sort from them.. game is kinda boring.. Endgame is not as big as yo uthink, you just repeat 3 stuff all over and over again. And make more characters. Honestly making more characters trying out classes is the only fun. Try it, but don't go heavy on it like i did.. I don't have many hours , but in the few hours i played i kinda YOLO and went hardcore and got to endgame with 2 characters and did a bit of enchanting etc trying to get good weapon.. its just pretty hell to get a good weapon. Most people struggle wong term. And still you wont be competitive.. Don't be competitive in TOS if you dont want to throw money at it ;)"
"This review focusses on one part of this game in particular: its controller support. Steam says partial controller support, and unfortunately that's accurate. The game really seems to have been designed for m+k, with controller support tacked onto it. All the hints at the start of the game refer k+m controls even when you set the ui to controller. There is a screen you can open from the options menu showing the controller bindings, but it doesn't have everything. It does have a LOT though, with your triggers and shoulder buttons as modifiers you can bind 20 skills or items to your abxy buttons, and then you can swap between pages if you need even more. It gets very confusing though, with other combinations used for certain actions (like right trigger + shoulder is resting). Still, you run into things that have you reaching for the mouse or keyboard again.It may be possible to play this mostly with a controller, buf if you're looking for an MMO you can play while lazing about on your couch, I'd say this is not it."
"The game had potential, and it was one of the most games i waited for.the things that made me stop playing the game is:- Trading system, you can't trade unless it's 1:1 trade and you can't trade gold.it forces the player to use in-game item as currency made by the players-Auction House: you can't list more than 1 item if you are Free-to-Play, you get the gold after selling it about 32hrs later.-the game doesn't completely supports gamepad-these are the most things that made quit, i know there's alot of problems like the bots that kills all the mobs instant combined with the respawn time, goldsellers, unreadable chat because of spammers, and lags sometimes, but thats can be solved.. the trade system itself is bad and the game relies too much on it."
"So far so goodI'd like to adress some complaints others are making:• Skill reset potionsSkill reset potions should not be used abundantly, reserching your build before actually playing the game in crucial. Calling the game ""pay to win"" after you couldn't get your build correct is not fair. I honestly wish skill reset potions were not an option.• GrindingIts an MMO, grinding is going to be in the game, that being said the game does a REALLY good job at limiting grinding untill around level 130. The first time I actually grinded in this game was level 130, up untill then smart XP card usage, dungeons (arguably grinding, but not really), and sidequests got me there.• Server LagYeah, it can be unbearable at times, though going on lesser populated channels will help this. Hopefully this is adressed in the future.• Frame dropsAgain, what the hell, my 980ti should not be choking in cities. Frames are only an issue in cities or areas with high amount of animiations, and I believe you can turn off animations for others. 98% of the time I had 60+ fps.If you want to play this game, do your damn research to avoid trobles down the road, and if you are skeptical wait untill it's free to play."

"Product received for freeThis game has some serious issues.- The best server for US/Canada is very laggy//rubberbanding and everyone is from brazil- There is alot of spam from bots/seller that will make you lag so much that you can't click anything- You need to pay $$ for almost anything from stash space to trading to market to skills rerolls, etc. and it really is expensive - The game is extremely repetitive and there is no way you can get around it (penalty exp if you try to go further then where you should be)This game has some real potential, feels like Ragnarok online all over again. I hope the devs fix it."
"Product received for freeSadly IMC can't handle it's own title letting bugs and broken mechanics in the game persists for over a year, coming from the closed beta test to official f2p launch.Can't recommend the game at present date.The very first thing I did on the first closed beta test was a bug report. Now the game had it's official launch I came back to play to see if they actually did all the fix they oh so claimed just to find the very same bugs, the very same misleading descriptions, the very same broken skills and attributes. The game core is actually fun but the bad optimization, server issues, lack of support (posts on official forums about tickets with weeks and no answer are quite common) and lack of transparency hurts it a lot.We're in the age of constant communication and for some reason IMC thinks ""ignoring it until everybody forget about it"" is a valid interaction with it's player base in regards of gameplay reports.The game had some bad design changes, removing many of the features they so bragged about in early interviews and hurting it in the long run.As PC Gamer review stated: ""One nostalgia trip you might want to skip"". And it's 58/100 score reflects the actual broken state of the game.But OH WELL, early access packs! Premium tokens! Beginners packs! Cash shop!"
"1/10- Too many BUGS (quests, login issues and etc...)- Very very very poor connection to the servers. SA player getting around 350ms to a US East Server.- Many mechanics broken, like Dungeon party finder, and the IMC games just dont care- Monsters respawn its too low, many quests its impossible to do becouse you need to drop a item but the monsters respawn that have the item its just too low- Too many BOTS of Silver Sellers spamming all the timeBottom line, this game will be a SCAM just like Infested (WAZ Z) was. Do not waste you time and money buying this game.That's is basic a PAID OPEN BETA."
Would been a lot better if dev support would consider the anomalies in the game. Very populated server (SEA) and no maintenance whatsoever is being done. Dungeon Finder is  not working also entering dungeons is very hard. Been over an hour trying to find a party in Dungeon finder queue.
"Pro:- The purpose of the game is good- The game cant hold you for many time with your friendsCon:- IMC do the worse thing which is doesn't provide feedback to players when a problem exists, they just dont care, doesn't answer no one at the forum- They doesn't listen the comunity- The SA servers doesn't receive the necessary infra structure"
"Product received for freeI do not recommend unless they fix how they are choosing to deal with stopping RWT. Trade restrictions, item potential, and other aspects are going to kill the game.EDIT:No progress has been made on optimization, trading, or RWT.DLC packs are now out and over priced as hell.Basically this comes out to about $30 for 15 days - 1 month of p2p with very few other benefits.For a broken game.. that's pretty f***ed up."
thought i come on here to relive my good ol iro days but i was sadly dissapointed.. game has bad optimzation and story is just terrible..game is full of boters and leet hackers. this game gets 1 out of 10 and would not install again.
"I've played this game in the Korean version previously (about 70 hours).Tree of Savior looks beautiful, sounds great and most of all feels great to play. The game has a solid foundation on most elements. There's a rather large world to explore with many different settings and furry animal sprites and the background music is stunning (although a little out of place in some zones) and the controls feel simple but great. You can jump to dodge attacks and skills, attack jump and overall the hitting animations and skills feel impactful and satisfying. The main appeal is obviously the class system as well as the long-term progression potential in the game, similar to what you'd see in Ragnarok Online.Unfortunately, the similarities end here. IMC felt like they had to turn most of the leveling experience into humdrum questing, which while not as terribly monotonous as most MMOs due to the variety of activities, is still pretty linear and predictable. There aren't many functional differences between maps either and most of the monster and boss difficulty is laughably easy for most classes. What feels fun at first quickly becomes a very repetitive grind which you have no choice over. Grinding mobs themselves is terrible in this game due to low spawn rates and overall low exp gains compared to dungeons and questing. In turn, this means your whole 'endless level' meme is just a bigger number for the typical endgame you see in most MMOs, which is easily attainable in a month or so of soul crushing quests and dungeons. The class system, while great in theory feels ultimately pointless most of the time since the content is too easy (or too annoying). Despite the interactive party system the game has very little incentives to actually group up since any group activity can (and is encouraged to) be automatized with dungeon matchmakers... In the end most of the old school feeling of finding parties or grinding with friends is thrown out of the window.There are also other terrible design decisions, such as the extremely limited trading unless you buy a monthly sub. For a game that encourages experimentation with so many classes it feels odd to not even allow gear transfers between characters unless you pay (and don't forget you'll have to do redo all the quests over again everytime you reroll). The cash shop is mildly pay2win as well and knowing IMC's track record with their previous games, it's only a matter of time until it becomes a massive P2W fest.In the end, I think this game has great potential and boasts a great baseline of building blocks, but IMC ultimately fails at trying to push the envelope and create something unique out of them and instead settles on creating another dull, forgettable Korean MMO just like Granado Espada. All the modern MMO troupes are back: the humdrum questing, linear leveling experience, little choice on player freedom, extremely streamlined solo content and penalizing just about any form of player interaction doesn't spell a long-term experience. It's also bug ridden some skills and classes don't even work the way they're supposed to, plus the optimization leaves a lot to be desired for a 2.5D game.While I encourage everyone to try it out once it goes F2P I can't really recommend anyone to pay for EA let alone spending anything in the cash shop."
"Product received for freeHonestly I can't recommend this game, all the issues that arise make it unplayable and frustrating.The game itself is pretty fun, you got a lot of variety in classes and the combat is enjoyable, not your generic mmorpg type of gameplay, but that's pretty much where the positives stop.It tries a bit hard to be Ragnarok, from visual design to certain mechanics, but it's obviously not. If you're going into the game looking for that, you'll be disappointed. There's a ton of monsters to kill, there's a big boss monster awaiting around every corner, but after a while I just start wondering whether those bosses were any different or meaningful to kill, none of them drop any interesting loot and overall the game is lacking in variety of loot. You have only a few tiers of items and often they don't even look different and you won't get any new usable items for a long time. You also find a ton of materials, but you got nothing to do with them, the crafting system is very shallow and boring.There are performance issues, the game isn't optimized very well, but it's not a dealbreaker. My computer isn't amazing, like 5 years old at this point and the only times I get bad performance issues is in towns with a lot of people, which doesn't matter that much since most of the gameplay takes place in other areas, so while I see a lot of people complaining about this, I think this is a minor issue that can be overlooked.Lag, however, can't be overlooked. If you ever played Lunia or Spiral knights and experienced lag in those games, you'll know what I'm talking about. This game is an action game that requires you to dodge attacks or attack and retreat, but the game is server based, meaning that every movement and attack you make on your screen doesn't matter, since it first has to register on the server and if there's even the slightest lag, things won't go your way. Even regular attacks become a chore to execute, as your character gets stuck after each attack until the server decides that you had executed the attack. Now you might say that lag is related to your internet rather than the servers, but that's not true, if you don't live anywhere near the servers(not the same continent), you're gonna have a bad time. Personally I get 150ms ping and that's already unplayable, at higher levels you need to react faster, but when enemies attack faster than your signal gets sent to the server and back, the game becomes unfair and frustrating. If the server is having issues, lags rise even higher and you start teleporting back constantly while going somewhere, enemies hurt you long after you ran past them and all kinds of things like that.The jumping mechanic seems like an interesting feature for this kind of game, but it is useless and not done right. Most areas don't utilize it, most maps don't even let you fall down from places to lower ground and just force you to go around or don't let you jump over some low obstacles like fences as if there's no such thing as jumping in the game. Jumping is meant to be used as an evasion maneuver and it's meant to be a split second action, but since the game is server based, if you're experiencing lag you can't use that at all to your advantage.Bots and spammers are also a big issue in the game, there's constant spamming and advertising of gold selling sites, the people that spam don't get banned for hours and keep spamming it in shouting chat which scrolls their message across the top of the screen all the time, which can't be turned off. Even after blocking a lot of those people, they constantly make new users and spam more and more of their crap. You also see a bunch of bots around the battlefields, reporting them doesn't seem to help much. I get that this issue is difficult to deal with for the GMs, but it's still incredibly annoying, I forgot that these things even exist considering I haven't seen them for a couple of years.Overall, I really dislike that this game is so server reliant, I get that it helps prevent cheating and all that, but it's also preventing me from playing the game properly, just like it used to be with Lunia and Spiral Knights for me."
"Good game, bad developerEdit: i returned after 2 year with the new event, the game is changed in a good way, still a good game, developer still bad. Give it a try and hope for the best."
"1º Trade is♥♥♥♥♥♥ can't trade silver[ingame currence] the reason is BS, if u don't have token gear become untradable.2º Auction House is even more ridiculous, non token can only put 1 item and 30% tax, token user can put 10 itens ate 10% this is so BS.Result, won't spend a dime in this game, not worth at all. they charging to a basic function to any MMO, a perfectly show of pay wall.And Now DLCs are region locked, this is a really bad decision, another reason to never spend a dime, even if for some rare desire I want to, I can't.Time after time IMC made bad decision, can not help but think will get worse."
"The game is full of glitches and bugs. When you enter the game via a certain Channel. You'll be surprised that you can't attack physically and can only move, and every monster is there trying to kill you, and you can't do anything at all.Painstakenly, you'll have to log out and change channels and pray that it'll let you in or the same bug is not present.Also, when you contact their support they don't respond for days!!!"
Product received for freeWhat kind of stupid game that limits someone from selling stuff at market to 1 item with 30% market tax only?? while premium players can put up to 10 items and 10% tax only??!? plus FIlled with bots and silver sellers.
"Although the game has been released as early access, the gameplay and experience does not feel like a finished product. I'll start with the positives before explaining the negatives. The core themes and graphics of the game are absolutely stunning such that it gives a great fantasy MMO experience. This combined with the stunning sound and music, really does immerse you into Tree of Savior's world perils. In the first hour of jumping in, the artwork and the graphics really emphasise the capacity and potential of what a great game this will be. With over 60 different classes to play and a complex class system which allows a variety of builds, you can be a unique character in a beautiful fantasy world. The level cap is also enormous, being at 600, which definitely shines as a MMO grinder with a long-term future and goal. Class skills and gameplay has been thought out and the combat system does feel fluid to the extent of how a 2.5D game should feel.  However, the game falls flat after an hour or two of gameplay, where buggy quests, an extensive lack of game features, poor lag and frequent disconnections have riddled the game to be a nightmare in itself. The game in itself is very linear and can likened to be sitting on a straight rollercoaster at a theme park. It seems that the developers have just made many maps, pieced them together and thrown one or two NPC's in each one to give quests. Furthermore, there are only two main 'cities' in the game which are your starting cities and the entire game's NPC vendors are situated in the two areas. Nowhere else in the entire game do you find any other vendors or non-quest related NPC's. This makes exploration poor and lacking for a person who loves to explore every inch of a map. Additionally, if you are a non-paying player who chooses not to purchase tokens(equivalent of buying 30day VIP status), then you will be unable to perform a wide range of basic game functions. A few of these functions includes trading and sending items/currency to other players, not being able to use shared storage between your characters and only being allowed to list one item on the Auction House at a time with a higher tax rate. However, it is not to say that you cannot purchase these 'tokens' on the Auction House given you are commited and dedicated grinder. The problems do not end at game design but also to the management of the game. Poor planning to this 'early release' can be seen in the troubles every player are having in completing quests, where server overloads are forcing players to wait 5-10minutes when talking to each NPC. At the time of this review, half of the channels are not working and it disconnects the players from the server entirely. It has been a few days and there is yet to be an update from the developers on the situation of this issue. Furthermore, there are many stories of character being 'stuck' on these disconnected servers and as such, players are stuck unabling to play. You'll be ripping out your hair more than the enjoyment of the game.I would strongly recommend new players to holdout from playing this game until there are further updates which fixes alot of the problems and issues this Tree of Savior has.Pros:+Great artistic visual graphics+Stunning sound and music +Diverse classes and character roles+Wide range of skills on characters+Core combat mechanics are smoothCons:-Bugged quests -Very linear gameplay and tunneled storyline. -Some basic ease of life features are poor, lacking or non-existant(eg- all NPC vendors are in two cities only)-Advertised as 'openworld' but not, with many average sized maps joined together-Keybind and mouse controls are strange-Laggy and overloaded servers (long wait times for mob spawns and when talking to NPC's)-All trading and commercial transactions are capped unless paid for-Alot of functions are currently broken. Entering dungeons disconnects your client-Gold seller spam stutters and lags your game client-Server crashes every few hours-Difficulty of the game is very easy but it is a MMO grinder-Lack of updates and communication from developer"
"I thought it was the real Ragnarok Online sequel or something like that, but I realise very fast that it was kind of Pay to win and all those anti farmer system with the auction house and other various thing that limit in a abusive way the way you can play ruined the game for me."

I'll explain some of the important points regarding my experience below. Trading system Trading was completely restricted when the game launched, personal 1-1 trades were only possible if you had a Token ( i'll explain what the token entails in the next point ) otherwise your only option to trade was using the Market, even then, trading silver was and still is impossible in 1-1 trades, with the recent patches they've lifted some of the restrictions. Allowing players to trade 1-1 without having a Token, albeit making the item untradeable if 1 of the parts don't have a Token or if their Token doesn't have any allowed number of trades left.Most of the mid-game and late-game recipes, gear and materials were untradeable at start, with a recent patch, all of these items became tradeable ( although materials still becoming untradeable after trading them once )  Token The Token is a micro transaction type of ''subscription'', with it, you can access the Team Storage and have several in-game effects such as being able to learn specific attributes instantly without having to wait a a certain amount of time, reduced Market commission fee ( non-token being 30% and with token 10% ), +3 increased movement speed, increased amount of Market listings ( non-token allowing 1 listing at a time and token allowing up to 10 ), 30% increased EXP from hunting mobs, +30 allowed number of trades ( if they run out, it makes items go untradeable in 1-1 trades and it's still possible to stack tokens for more allowed number of trades ), +1 increased maximum buff count, being able to use Premium Emotes and +1 extra instance entry for missions and dungeons. People can still buy the token with or without cash, using in-game silver to buy it from Market. Market The Market still has several restrictions to it, such as a wait time before the item gets listed ( from 30 minutes up to 2 hours ) and once it's been sold there's a wait time before you're able to collect the money ( it being 2 days ) unless you have a token, then there's no wait time, you also have to be lvl 40 and your ToS account has to be 7 days old in order to partake into Market and 1-1 transactions. Team Storage The Team Storage has also changed a lot in the recent patches, people are allowed to use it to store silver and items ( as long as they're tradeable or allowed to be transferred ) and send them to another of your alts, thing that wasn't possible when game launched, still you must have a token in order to use the Team Storage. Bots Bots have always been an issue with F2P market games such as ToS, bots were a truly painful issue the first few months after the game started, they still are however not as bad as before, nowadays bots get banned much faster and some of the maps aren't as clustered with bots as before.  Drops Most of the rare items that drop in the open world such a monster gems, gear used for crafting BiS items and overall unique stuff, work under a system called Drop Per Kill ( DPK for short ) even though it's not confirmed, there might be a short variation of the amount of kills needed before a specific item drops, still, this system doesn't allow an item to drop more than 2 times right next to each other as opposed to luck based drops ( RNG ), the mob kill count is fixed to the channel you're hunting in, the kill count is also reset by maintenances and channel/server crashes making it very hard to get super rare quality items or items that require a high amount of kills, with the current spawn time of certain mobs and the decreasing population, this has been an issue. Solo vs Group Content It's possible and doable to level a char up to 200-220 by not relying on others for parties to do missions or dungeons of any sort, but as the game progress specially mid-game/late-game you have to group up to do mercenary missions and grind parties, the newest content patch ( rank 8 ) increased the level cap from 280 to 330, the new maps are pretty hard to complete unless you have a specific class or a group to be able to, this is a problem due to the decreasing amount of players, it's hard to find a party, namely mercenary missions in my case which start at level 100 and scales all the way to 330, queueing up with players of similar levels in order to start the instance, even though the queue system is cross server ( servers are divided in regions and said regions share cross server queueing ) it's not easy to find people unless it's at peak hours. I want to give this review a positive remark because i believe the game still has potential to grow even though there's been a lot of problems with gameplay such as the restrictions to trade system, just to name 1, i believe they can still change their ways to make this a better game even though the maintenances breaks stuff here and there once in a while, they've done some positive changes since release such as lifting some of the trade restrictions that were set in the beginning. If you've reached this point, i hope you enjoyed the review. Thanks for reading!!  "
"can not install and patch game due to direct x 10 setup problem The devs seam unable or unwilling to fix this problem if you want to dig through alot of  bs files you can work around this but why do i have too DEVELOPER:IMCGAMES Co.,Ltd.PUBLISHER:IMCGAMES Co.,Ltd.FIX YOUR DAM GAME 0 out of 10"
"The game was fun at the beginning, but as you advance trough it you will notice the amount of bugs/bots/annoying wasted time/gold sellers is not going to be that fun anymore.Farming stuff is fun if you enjoy grinding, but you should try a different game cause the drop system in this game is broken(you might drop the item or you might not, ever) not to mention you will fight for mobs with tons of bots and the system is so stupid, you might farm an item, and the bot might have the luck of getting it and the drop is reseted again.Questing is somewhat decent, but considering this game needs you to make multiple characters, you will get sick of the same quest over and over again. Not to mention some key quests are still bugged.Dungeons ahahah what a big joke :))* You will spend half a day in queues to finish your dungeons/missions/etc. I mean if you have that kind of luxury to waste your time waiting sure, go for it !Social life is not bad but low. Meaning not so many players left on any servers except maybe the Asian ones. Some players are sociable, most are not, but you might find a helpfull guild with some good social players. The game has so many ridiculous bugs and it's been like more than a year since they fully released the game. Graphical Bugs, Sound Bugs, Quest Bugs, Skill Bugs, Map Bugs, Chat Bugs, UI Bugs...The game is advertised as a F2P(free too play) but if you wont use a Token(premium token bought with $$$) you will miss out on some really basic stuff. Like storing silver in your storage, trading with other players(well you can trade but the item will become untradable so wasted) and much more. But it's possible to play without a token if you enjoy playing solo, pve. And some people will tell you you can farm a token, true, but considering the drop system is broken and bots, good luck :))Final thought: I had some moments where I did enjoy playing the game, but trust me I would never advise any of my friends to play it. It's too broken, the people who manage the game don't care so much and take forever to fix the game. Not to mention if you have an issue and you make a ticket you can wait up to a month for a reply, that's how fast and reliable they are!Don't bother with the game, give it more time, maybe a year or two so the people who manage it sell the game to a more competent gaming company or fix the issues with it."
"I've gotta hand it to you IMC, you had a rough, rocky start and you're still not the best but you're learning and improving.Full disclosure, I was hype for this game from the moment that it was announced- I'm a long-time ragnarok online player, I applied for every closed beta they had, and I even paid for the most expensive beta slot that was available. To me, this was set up to explode as the next big thing!- But then it wasn't. I didn't get terribly far in the beta so I didn't quite reach the point where the cracks in design became evident. I was also riding high off of a sense of nostalgia and longing for another game to fill the Ragnarok Online niche so I was pretty blinded.Eventually it came out of beta and launched for real- I was a little less enthusiastic but I was going to rush into it headfirst and be one of the best, so I thought. I tolerated the fairly decent story and the seemingly on-rails quest lines, but reaching one of the big levelling curve dead zones that were prominent back then I finally gave up. I agreed with what others were saying- Skills didn't have scaling, which made all earlier choices completely pointless. The diversity of classes was seemingly an illusion, the grinding was fun but issues with spawn behaviors severely hampered it in all but a few scant zones. The lack of PVP made some more PVP-centric classes immensely underwhelming and further limited the amount of interesting things to play-... You see where I'm going. I quit, wrote it off as a huge mistake and thought I'd never look back.Then comes the most recent patch, completely and utterly reworking stats, gear, and several skills in the game. I hemmed and hawed at the idea but I still really want a true Ragnarok successor so I gave it a shot- and I was completely blown away!The game has changed so much for the better. Grinding feels fresh and rewarding, the addition of dozens of very very low drop chance niceties make it feel like no amount of grinding is ever a waste, when you have a chance to drop dungeon instant clear vouchers or dungeon exp multiplier tokens from enemies. Boss cards have more usage than just the three classes that used to use them, now. Gear feels rewarding and solid- they have a good amount of staying power and it's actually quite nice to boost, enchant, reforge, gem socket and otherwise trick out the pieces of gear that you really like. The classes have so many interesting interactions and skills that play off of one another in strange and unique ways that every party you join up with feels different. Oh wow, this time we have a psychokino that can pull every enemy in the dungeon into a line that's just perfect for our monk to blast with energy beam- Oh fantastic we have a peltasta to pull mobs into my fully casted meteor- Oh look a that the identifier just gave our hoplite a baffling amount of crit so that her stabbing special move instantly murders this boss. The list goes on, and they're all fun to explore.There's a ton more nuance to things and it seems like IMC are working hard to bring back an incredibly nostalgic, fun grinding game that caters to a lot of different playstyles. I applaud them for this, and can't wait to see where things go- Especially with the Klaipeda rennovation coming right around the corner.As an answer to the negative nancies with completely unrealistic expectations here- Yes, the game isn't perfectly optimized. If you play on an AMD card expect sub-optimal performance. On the flip side, for Intel cards the game plays perfectly even on older computers while still looking great.The game isn't perfect by any stretch- I'm not saying it is. What I can say is that it started badly but is quickly gaining ground. If you decide to play, keep in mind that it's come a long way and seems to continue trekking along towards being an extremely fun game. IMC isn't afraid to admit when they heck up, and they're overwhelmingly generous with compensation for the times that they do manage to heck up. If you've looked at this before, written it off, or even played in the beta and were left feeling like the game had potential but wasted it, I highly encourage you to give it another shot."
"SummaryTOS is a beautiful 2.5D game with amazing artistic designs. Customization creates depth in the game-play. However, players interaction could be further encouraged. Game play needs to be more balanced. More varieties need to be implemented. Given the momentum of the developers, the game has a lot of potentials to be greater.ProsThis game is an eye candy. The maps and character designs are amazing. It truly stepped up its game in the artistic department comparing to Ragnarok, which was a beautiful game to begin with. The map has different layers of backgrounds creating such depth. You may be crossing a bridge high up in the mountain while finding other players fighting monsters deep in a small valley underneath. A 2.5 D game with such style puts even many 3D MMORPG in shame. The game offers an enjoyable RPG experience. It allows so much customization. The number of classes and skills in each allows two late game characters of the same class to have completely different play styles. The drop rate is decent. Gears are easy to get. I never find myself short of resource to buy merchandises. Free users are at little disadvantage comparing to the paying ones.The devs are still actively fixing the game's issues. The lagging issue which was causing huge uproar was fixed in a week. The trade system has been brought back. The developers listen to what their customers want and they make it happen. This game is being constantly improved. Hopefully the user experience would be even better in the future.ConsThe game struggles to create a cohesive experience as a MMORPG. It does not encourage players to cooperate. For example, doing quests alone is far more rewarding than anything else due to the low difficulty of the game. This results in every player focusing on playing alone rather than being part of the greater world. Remember the merchants on the streets of the major cities in Ragnarok making the world so lively? The market place is a cheap replacement to that formal glory. Even though there are plenty players, it lacks a spirit of a living world. The classes are not balanced. Despite allowing customization, certain build provides far better leveling experience comparing to another. It requires user to do their homework before actually playing the game. Some skills are traps by being completely under-powered. It is not that kind of game which rewards you for being devoted to a certain path. Hence stepping on to the wrong path means either starting over or buying $ item to reset the character.Lastly, behind its pretty face, the game gets repetitive really fast. All minions on every level feels the same from lv1 to lv50. It is great to fight a boss every now and then, but it feels like the same boss with different skins/animations except a few. Quest comes in different formats, but all too trivial. They should be more distinctive and memorable. However, the hidden ones are really pleasant surprises. I remember finding a red gem which took me to a boss battle against a monster guarding it. Make these more common! Overall, the grinding experience feels a bit bland.ConclusionIt has been fun, but I am stopping playing this game because the cons outweigh the pros. I will not enjoy the same experience for another 35 hours. The game is still worth a try for new comers."
"Pros: music, variety of classes (4 basic classes that branch out), dungeon vouchers, dungeon aestheticsCon: everything else.  Leveling is a chore.  Combat not fun.  To craft stuff, you'll need items much higher than the end product's level (example: level 80 materials to craft level 40 gear).  Professions are linked to a class (ex: squire can repair items) , same if you want to make a guild.  The map is all over the place.   A level 90 place can be surrounded by level 200."
bought and started the game thinking i could join my cheap♥♥♥♥♥friends thats waiting for it to be free and now they announced that all new players will be on another server and i bought the DLC 2-1 and 2-2 twice but didnt received the items tried to contact steam and IMC its been a week and still they didnt respond on my Ticket dont buy this game
Now i would love to give a legit review on this game however after uninstalling 5 times and calling customer service and still finding no option to fix the screen resolusution in a good timely manner i never really got to play the game more than the 10 mins  looked promising but i just dont have a good vibe about it now lol im over it
Not the game I wished it was. It pains me to see TOS have even mild success with whatever devs initially put out and surviving until now. Especially when it had so much potential...I'm sure the negatives have been covered in these reviews plenty of times so I won't go more in-depth.
"This game had so much damn potential, it was what we all wanted Ragnarok Online 2 to be. I'm going to get right into it, don't even ♥♥♥♥ing waste your time on this game.1. The lag, what in the ♥♥♥♥.2. Most unoptimized game I have EVER played, holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥  I'm out here playing Overwatch on 144fps ALL DAMN DAY.  I get on this♥♥♥♥♥♥show of a game and holy ♥♥♥♥, it sucks so much that it was even crashing my google chrome today.3. If I didn't know better, I'd guess Riot games was in charge of the balancing of the classes.4. Every 3 months they do another same event where everyone gets free stat resets and class resets.  If you're a new player, you get free dungeon reset vouchers all the way 'til max level meaning you get max level in a day or two depending on how continuous you grind.  You also get insane buffs that let you one-shot everything no matter what your build is which forces you to just be an archer with max attack speed. 4.5.  Don't bother putting actual work into getting to max level and actually expect it to mean anything considering anyone can get it.5.  What is end-game?  LOL.  6.  They removed the 2nd NA server so everyone is now on one server which is cool but they also took all the dungeon entrances and put it in the main town.  They took the small community of 400 players and shoved them all in the main ""city"" to make it look like the game was thriving, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.MAybe if you morons would've focused on optimizing the game and making it more user-friendly, you would've kept growing when you threw that very first event where everyone got max level in a day and made multiple accounts to make multiple characters.  100% garbage and even though I'm ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at how much of a trashcan it is, I'm disappointed at the same time.PS:  This is my 3rd account, I've got about 15 characters off the top off my head, levels 100 - ~360"
Great Ragnarok-Style Mmorpg! Big Playerbase and under the best 5 Mmorpgs in Japan! This will get supported for a long time! Start playing now if you like old school!There is a fair amount of grindingFair amount of collectingand fair amount of questing10/10
"This game alone is great! But the way it's being administrated is... Doesn't exist a bad enough word to describe.This game was soo Hyped as the MEGA famous ""True Ragnarok 2"" and had everything to be perfect, it would sell itself. BUT this GOOD game was incredible destroyed by it's publisher. IMC (the publisher) Completely SU..C..KS in making decisions. Don't even PAY for this game, it will kill your hype and will frustrate all your dreams (unless you are a white knight fanboy that doesn't accept the game's failure).PROs:- The game is fun at the beginning- The Art is nice- The class system is very versatile, alot of possible builds that can fit any playstyle- Interesting story- Not straight foward side quests, you really have to explore the world to find themCONs:- IMC- Badly optmized- Worst monster spawn system I ever seen on a GRIND MMO (you sit and wait around 3 minutes for monsters to respawn and them get instant killed by the other players and everyone is back to the waiting room)- Bots and gold sellers already conquered the game, the situation is chaotic.- Not enjoyable game later on (might be in the FAR FAR future)- Bad server connection, is better now comparing with the first week, but.... yeah, meh.- Bad customization on character creation (Worst than Ragnarok)- Alot of bugs (some of the FIRST CLOSED BETA is still there)- Unbalanced Verdict: disappointing / waste of money and time."
"would I recommend this game to others? Probably. Would I recommend this game to RO Players? No.First let's just start off from my background and why I wanted to play the game, and I'll be very brief in this.TL;DR  We played alot of RO back in the days and loved itYears ago, I and my friends fell in love with an MMORPG called Ragnarok Online, it was the best mmo we've played for a long time, to the point where we would even use our monthly allowance to pay for time in the game instead of things like food and stationery. The game had everything we loved, great music, vast world, danger even in safe areas, and the freedom to decide on what we want to do, how to do it, and how to grow our characters, it was basically a great adventure for all of us.Years past by, and we heard of Ragnarok Online 2: Gate of the world, the music was alright but the game wasn't that good, and then there was the infamous Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the second, I don't want to go into the details on this but let's just say that we decided that we're better off playing E.T. the video game (we didn't), than RO2.And then Tree of Savior was announced, and boy were we excited, we made a promise to return together and we waited, and now that it officially opened, we were disappointed...Tree of Savior isn't a bad game as a whole, it has good points like;- The freedom to build your character however you like- Nice music (though personally not as great as RO1's)- Great artwork and design- Good flow of combat- Easier UI- The Goddesses are packed with good ""Plot"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)bHowever it is packed with problems that does put a damper on the game such as;- Bugs- The requirement for premium to do things like trading, or setting up a buy shop, or even selling things in the market (you're limited to how much you can sell, and there will be higher tax imposed)- Lag, even with good connection, you're prone to experience game stopping lags- Botters- SpammersAnd because we were expecting it to be like RO, here are the problems of the game from my perspective;- Lesser rate of healing while sitting- Handheld throughout the game with quests, so we don't really have much of a choice in progressing.- The premium feels Pay2Win-ishConclusionSo would I recommend this game to others? Probably. Would I recommend this game to RO Players? No. So far i am not impressed with how IMC has handled the game, or even the game itself, I am hoping that it would eventually get better, but that has to wait"
"There's no direct trade among players. You must create trade house for TP points (donate). What the hell? Are you serious? Many other bags too. Quests in party sometimes just drops and you cannot complete it until relogin. Sometimes game teleport you to other channel without your teammates. Yeah, pretty cool. On present moment there's more negative things over positive. I hope they will fix it. Until then, i will not recomend it for you. Better to go in Ragnarok Online, it's more fun and stable."
Many bugs. Bots everywhere. No PVP. Terrible server lag. No customize options. No class balance. Dupers. Unannounced regional price rise. Terrible choices and absolutely no respect for playerbase.
"Disclaimer - I play this game because I enjoyed RO and it ties a group of my friends together that want to play similar gamesLong story short, Company's not ready for SEA releaseServer sufferedBoot all free playersOnly allow Paid player to play in SEA serverNo explaination, No statement from companyPathetic company trying to save a pathetic piece of♥♥♥♥♥"
"I'll be brief Cons- lag issues- gold sellers- game full of bugs- extremely boring to play, no challenge at all.- boring location design- bad game control- no character customization- 30% tax on auction for non premium players- pay $$$ for being able to use auction properly- pay $$$ to reset skills- pay $$$ to trade- pay $$$ so u can learn 2 passive skills at the same timebasically just pay for everything.- limited to visit any dungeon 2 times per day- easy to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up your character Just don't buy this game unless they atleast deal with lags and make trade for free."
"Very Nice game, most of the problems and old reviews are already fixed, people complain about the game need more content because they have nothing more to do, but they forget the game open to free players 10may, im writing this review 12 jun, now think...The bad reviews are from players complaining about there nothing more to do, but they think the game is do one character and put them max level... when we ask but what about achivs? end gear? maps? collections? adventure jornal? etc and etc.... they do nothing, they are spoil kids, they complain about grind, they for sure never played RO hehe.I never grind in this game because i do every single quest, more collection more maps, dungeon, party quests, missions and etc... this game if its played in is total have a LOT to do and its fun, if you want to rush and grind like a boring kid, ye its going to s=ck.I recommend a lot this game, just dont read the trollers and butthurt kids from the forum and reviews, play ur game and enjoy it ;)"
"Do not be misled by the reviews of others, you absolutely must try this game for yourself. That said, it is a throwback to old-school MMORPG's like Ragnarok & Maple it is absolutely fun to play and doesn't get bored as fast. There are problems currently that plague the game and Developers doing their absolutely level best to fix them and make TOS more enjoyable for all.TL;DR : Play the game, it's fun but there are issues. Don't let the issues put you off as they are neglectable."
"If you don't have pacience, or want to play for fun, don't even bother yourself buying the founder's acess. It's almost unplayable. Spammers selling silver, minutes loading maps and contantly server lag. We hope when the server come up for free, they manage to solve this.Still, it's a great game. The gameplay is interesting, the musics and sounds are really good and the party play is awesome. If you don't mind playing with lag, it's a really good game."
"Edited on 11/27/16 after break and 1 month return :This game is still great. I wish that this game continues to grow and thrive, and that more people will come to know it. This is a wonderfully unique game with so much class customization, unique gameplay between classes and sub-classes, as well as a living player run economy of all kinds of crafted weapons, recipes, items, armor sets, monster cards, gems, hats, and more! I am on Klaipeda (NA) and though the population has declined since launch, as all MMO's do, there are still plenty of people in town and you bump into people while out leveling all the time. Some sub-classes are able to sell class specific buffs that normally other people couldn't use, but you get to rent them for coin. Others repair your armor and weapons over the typically limit so you have to take less trips to town, and there are others as well who provide services to other players when they aren't out adventuring. There are just too many things that are great about this game. I wish that you would give it a chance and learn to love it like I do. Whether you want to have a few minutes soloing and grinding for ""zen"" feelings, or you want to get into a group to farm experience or items or run dungeons this game can accomodate many different feelings. If you need friends or are looking for a guild, please check out the Treeofsavior.com forums as well as Tree of Savior Fanbase which is also a great website for mapping out your Class builds and all your skill points. There is also an item search database on that website for when you are having trouble finding something or someone. This game has been touted as the ""spiritual succesor of Ragnarok Online"" and it holds true to that, but It's also so much more including much more varied class choice, customization and an incredibly more fluid movement and combat system. Good luck, and may the Goddess watch over you!Eldaran - Klaipeda Server (NA)"
"Best MMORPG I've ever play. Why? +Best BGM+Best Art Design+Unique Character Classess+Realistic camping, selling skills specially Squire, Alchemist, and Pardoner.  Thaumaturge class is one of those funniest class if you combine him w/ Centurion (i can only say the TROLL is real). Must have this game its really enjoyable play!"
"Tree of Savior has a lot of bugs and issues, but damn this game is fun, even hitting mobs for no reason looks cool, definitely not a perfect game, but with the wide class variety and possibilities, great visuals and good soundtrack you can have a very good time playing this, especially if you play with friends."
"Thank god i didn't waste money with this game.Too many technical issues that makes this game unplayable, literally. I mean, i currently can't login due to a connection bug that happens when you enter in some specific dungeons and it's been like this for days.Now besides not being unable to log in, i need to wait in a 700+ queue for every _failed_ connection attempt. I just got mad, uninstalled.0/10 - Would never play again."
"It's just a ripoff. Don't spend a single dollar on this, or you will get: Endless lag, connection unstability, broken quest chains with long hours of farming, broken game in general, no response from admins, lots of compensation items for these issues which you won't be able to use since you won't be able to connect ... Perhaps you could wait until they release F2P mode, but again ... If you can't really log in and play, what's the point? Waste of time & money. 1/10."
"too low FPS I initially came upon this game looking for something to fill the time between earlier this month and the release of Bless Online and seeing as it was something I hadn’t tried and marking the many similarities between this game and Ragnarok Online I decided to give it a try.This game does nothing innovative with its questing system nor with its leveling. The quests are mostly just generic fetch or kill quests. Even the main story quests are simply variations upon these basic quest types making leveling to 360 a needlessly tedious process. Forgive me for drawing a comparison here as I feel like I may trigger some fanboys but Guild Wars 2 does an excellent job addressing this issue in terms of quest design. Guild Wars 2 has things called heroic heart quests which are essentially optional quests you can do alongside the main quests for additional exp and some karma (in-game currency for various goods). The great thing about these heart quests is most if not all of them can be done in various ways. Say you’re tasked with collecting apples. You can either a) kill monsters who may have the apples, b) shake trees to get the apples out, c) buy the apples from somewhere to give to the quest npc. You have options and that kind of diversity makes questing feel like less of a chore and more of an active experience. You feel in charge of how you’re tasked with progressing. Even the main story quest gives you options and branching paths depending upon the choices you make. This isn’t a concept isolated to Guild Wars 2 either. SWTOR puts this idea into play very well evolving the story into something personal and relatable, giving you a sense of connection to your character since his story has evolved according to the choices you’ve made. Tree of Savior already suffers from a lack of voice acting, at many times I found the story-line to be nonsensical or at the very least badly translated, and 100% of the time I found myself referring to my avatar as the “Revelator, Performer of Menial Tasks” as every goddamn NPC in the world seems to believe you to be personally responsible for gathering their dinner or chopping down goddamn trees less than 5 meters away from where they’re standing. It’s hogwash and absolute rubbish. Even the “hidden” class quests are artificially difficult. What I mean by this is many times you find yourself in a game where progression is locked behind difficult content. This is fine. Having to do a difficult quest or hunt for rare materials for a job progression quest or to progress the story is totally understandable in my opinion. But when you lock progression behind “artificial” difficulty by simply making the quest in question tedious beyond belief it’s simply bad quest design. The appraiser quest has you sitting for hours in the same spot waiting for a flower to spawn which you spend another hour watering if you’re solo. This isn’t rewarding gameplay at all. Where are the actual quest mechanics? It simply looks like an obnoxious nudge from the developer to resort to buying gacha boxes to not have to deal with the tedium of performing the quest itself. Don’t even get me started on the Bulletmarker quest. Other games have acknowledged this sort of tedium when they realize they haven’t made engaging quests and at least put in auto-pathing to save your sanity from how mindless their questing is. I don’t condone this idea at all since it makes MMOs look like mobile games but at least the feature is there when they know they’ve made terrible quests.Exploration and immersion.You outlevel zones much too quickly in some cases for you to truly immerse yourself in exploration, though I appreciate the creativity in some areas (elevators and that amusing mine cart sequence where you get thrown across the map). Apart from that however there aren’t very many ways for you to interact with your environment apart from a few “gimmicks”. There are no platforming segments, no secret areas and while I must concur that this might not have been a goal in the minds of the level design team, it would have been a nice touch nonetheless. The fact that the adventure journal rewards you for exploration is a point in the game’s favor.As mentioned earlier though, the badly translated lines and the lackluster story-line ruined any sort of immersion for me. The amount of busywork also destroyed any sense of connection I had with my character as I felt like my revelator was simply a glorified yes-man.Bosses, Dungeons, and RaidsDungeons in this game are simply exercises in tedium yet again. Admittedly, they get far easier thanks to power-creep from gear (which I have strong words about later) but once again they’re basic and sub-par. They’re also largely wasted opportunities for community building. Many games implement level-scaling into their dungeons and dynamic rewards which are adjusted to compensate for higher-level characters wishing to participate in lower-level dungeons with their friends. People do not run the lower-level dungeons simply because it’s unrewarding for them to do so. This leaves the community with characters in the lower levels not having anybody to run dungeons with and creates scenarios where people with higher level alts cannot participate in content with their friends who may have only just started the game. This game’s dungeon system would feel so much more alive with dynamic level adjustment and scaling rewards. Just saying.Now as for the bosses and the dungeons themselves… Oh my god where to begin. There are no real mechanics. And any that DO exist are simply hammered into irrelevancy due to the power-creep from gear. Where are the puzzles? Where are the intricate mechanics you find so prevalent in so many of today’s MMOs boss encounters? You could argue that things like “kill that mob to damage the egg” count as mechanics but that’s barely different from the atypical questing you already did during the leveling process to begin with… I don’t know if it was simply impossible to implement these things based upon the design of the game itself but the developers could honestly have tried harder in my opinion. I haven’t encountered anything in this game that couldn’t be killed with enough of a dose of “hit it in the face til it dies”. The raid in this game (Earth Tower) has no business calling itself a real raid. It’s simply more artificial difficulty locked behind even more gear power-creep. To illustrate my point let’s draw another parallel. Now mind you this is a boss with one of the “simpler” mechanics in Guild Wars 2. There’s a raid boss in Guild Wars 2 called the Vale Guardian. In his normal state the entire party can damage and hit him. Every 33% percent health he loses he “phases” and splits into three separate forms. At this point the party separates into two or three teams depending on how you deal with the split. His blue form can only be damaged when a buff that makes it immune to damage is stripped. His green form can only be damaged by physical attacks. His red form only takes condition or “dot” damage. You split the party up depending on who can do what. When all three splits die he reforms back into his original form. You have a set amount of time to damage him in his original form and to do the split phases until the enrages and will typically wipe the raid. REAL mechanics. Where are they in ToS???The Social Element) WHY IS GLOBAL CHAT HIDDEN BEHIND A CASH SHOP ITEM? This kills player interaction! There isn’t even map chat. I read somewhere that it was possibly to stop gold sellers from spamming chat or yada yada yada but…they do anyway. They buy megaphones with free TP. You could have solved this dilemma in so many other ways that would have not hampered player interaction. a) ban the bots (what you actually should be doing to begin with) b) ban the chat spammers c) give people expanded block-lists so they can block gold sellers themselves Restricting chat to a premium service does nothing good"
"Great game for the player who longs for an experience like the original Ragnarok Online. Beautiful art style and impecable soundtracks combined with a fun gameplay with vast possibilities.Character can be created in one of 4 main classes: Swordsman, Archer, Cleric and Wizard.Each one of the classes can evolve to numerous different professions within the game, on a total of eight ranks. This combined with the several skills for each profession as well as skill enhancements can increase the odds of your character being unique on the game.My recommendation is, download and try for yourself! Pretty sure you will enjoy your time!"
"If you are a fan of original Ragnarok online, this is a must have. Great gameplay, soundtrack and class depth.pros: Its like modern RagnarokSoundtrackClass system is insanely deepCons:sometimes it  lagstheres no class reset system, not very friendly for new playerspopulation is low, if you want to run dungeons without waiting 15minutes, you have to log in at peak hours ( europe )"

"I once called this game the best MMO I've ever played, and honestly, it definitely did enjoy it the most out of any MMO I've played so far (and I've played quite a few), but after coming back and seeing that the developers STILL have not fixed any of the issues that had prevented me from continuing to enjoy the game, I have finally given up hope on this game I once held in such high regard. RIP Tree of Savior."
Srry i will recomend this game if not lag.. BUT since it so LAG .. ALWAYS MAINTENCE .. AND SO SO SO many PROBLEM.. SAVE YOUR MONEY and YOUR TIME is better.. WASTE my money+time and im so regret it.
"Perhaps the most interesting concept Ive seen for an MMO, it even made me feel that there's still hope on this genre. From the guy who is behind Ragnarok online who wouldn't be hyped right? I remember the time when I was watching those trailers, the gameplay,  the art, 80 characters,  awesome music, I said to myself this is what I want. But sadly the game died without realizing its full potential.""There's no such parent who don't love their child.""I also had believed that this could be applied to developer and game relationship as well,  but God I was wrong.  I never had seen a developer who don't give a sh*t about their players or their game, they just milk the game until there is nothing left,  poor cow. I'm one of the most tolerant player you could have seen,  I even don't mind if classes are unbalanced or the game in not open world, but 2 cardinal sins in MMO have been existing since beta which are worst optimization and rampant botting, and I don't see it will be resolved in the near future or if ever at all. The game that made me believe that there's still hope for MMO and the game that literally made me lose hope on this genre."
"how to say... check the forum and you'll understand!beautiful game but infected by bots, fps droprate etcmmo without a real discussion channel (go in instance, say ""hi"" and that's all)limited guild members numbers...got 2 years of subscription in token very fast (just trading, no Z afk or farming hours)now i'm just playing 5 mn to ""rush"" instance (it really take 1 mn to finish most of dungeon)i'll come back, sure, to see if there's some new contents! or for the final picture before closing :)(less than 700 players on EU server and it continue to drop!)call a medic!!!"
"Yea tried this game out thinking hey it might be fun like ragnarok but hell no, you litteraly have to pay real life money to do a dungeon repeatedly you seriously have to pay to play and that is just out right ridiculous having to pay to play a free game the irony here shady buisness for a shady game I would understand the normal concept of buying cosmetics or things to help your char but to have to buy things to be able to get acces to parts of the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"
i only play the game a bit but now cant play it any more it wont even stat up iv install it on 3 pc and reinstall the game 5 or more time per pc and steam 2 or 3 time and still will not work dont wast your money because it might just stop working all together
"Can't reccomend game at this point.- Economic balances by developers melted down market (just Korean dev style to fight RTM and Bots)- No adequate trading WITHIN account to trade items and currency between your own charecters (excuses about fight RTM and Bots cannot be applied about this matter)- Party Matchmaking doesn't consider such thing as Party Role (have fun running dungeons with 4 clerics or 4 mages or 4 warriors. If you are not playing with friends - sucks to be you)- Idk what in korean version of game, but my guess that in Europe devs rent hardware in some dc - so expect lags and delays of the servers (not latency problems if you ask)"
"cool game.one suggestion, make all UI mode available to all classes. though they are working just fine, in some quest i need to switch from mouse mode to keyboard mode.It would be great if every mode is working fine regardless of class."
"I think this game is good if you like games like Ragnarok Online, and these things, the problem is little bugs and improvements that must do, but if you have patience in this, you could enjoyed Tree of Savior, because IMC are getting better every days and remove bugs.The only thing I can say is very disgusting for me, is the CENSURE. For the rest, I think is a good game. Good music, good quest, enjoy the classes, good accesories… I like it. I remembered when I played Ragnarok online :9I hope IMC bring up soon the TP ^^ and more accesories, dresses and hairs.ADD VERY IMPORTANT: I need to add something VERY IMPORTANT. And the thing is that IMC MUST IMPROVE MANY THINGS so that game have a GOOD NOTE. Is totally INSANE that you have LIMITED TRADES, and objects that you have in your character its imposible TRADE with your friend, EVEN IF IN YOUR OWN CHARACTER, is INSANE, really. I think YOU CHANGE THIS. Even if you have a TOKEN, you cannot trade with normally, really is INSANE. And I’m very angry for one more thing, I don’t undertand why not can TRADE MY PREMIUM THINGS like HAIR for another character. Really, this a fraund.If IMC not repare those things I change my value note in the game."
"Game's great. a little tough to get the hang of, but being made by the original ragnarok creator and that swag class system give me hope. arena pvp and guild v guild prove to be promising, final words, young game, bright future, addicted.ps i spend more time thinking about the leveling than grinding but still love the game xD"
"Product received for freeLike: The art style, combat, intuitive UI, avg/low system requirementsDislike: If you forget ONE thing in terms of main/side quests, map completion, etc; it is UNFORGIVING and you have to go back and GRIND to find out what was missed, and the extremely limited character customizing is depressing since it's an rpg.  My first time through I got stuck at a lvl 40 dungeon, so I looked up a walkthrough (which already killed the game) and apparently I was rushing through the game too quick because YOU HAVE TO get 100% map completion. The reason why you need 100% map completion is because it gets you ""adventure points"" which are used for numerous things (money, exp, etc.). The NPC's are also ""hidden"" and you have to pain stakingly find each one. In return, they give you a side quest that is IMPARATIVE for quick lvl'ing. I immediatley got bored when my lvl 40  character had to go to the BEGINNING OF THE GAME just to make the 95% completed map a 100%. I then had to do this over and over and over again for every location up to the point of where I was originally at.... The game looks great and the combat is fun, but DAYMN it is unforgiving as f."
"Product received for freeTree of savior. the true successor to Ragnarok, the game that made my childhood awesome, I've played Ragnarok for 5 years, both the original server and the private servers were AWESOME!!! I was hyping for this game for like several months, hoping it would be as GOOD as Ragnarok, be as NOSTALGIC as Ragnarok, and most importantly, be as NON PAY2WIN as Ragnarok... but now I got to try it out, no, in my opinion to be honest it broke my heart, not its current pay2win restrictions, but its main gameplay... I thought it would really resurrect what Ragnarok would be, and would bring back the good old memories of how awesome Ragnarok was.. here are the cool stuff and the drool mush, and the comparison of Tree of savior and Ragnarok to explain why:(UPDATE)The cool-Awesome music-Lots of classes to pick with tons of skills to try out-cute looking characters-Good art style-Tons of quests with a good story in each of itThe drool-horrible performance in servers especially on SEA and SA servers-lots of bots and silver vendors flooding the chat-very limited character customization, i expected it would be a little colorful, like the EYE COLOR, literally all of players and npcs have hazel brown eyes, hair color is not a starter, one needs to complete a very tedious task to earn one, JUST ONE-multiplayer is pointless, you will most likely to grind alone since there are a lot of bots killstealing all over the place-trade is restricted to free players (accdg to others, i dont know about now)-you can only put ONE item in market as a free player...-basically pay2win, most of the new exclusive items require real money, than real hardwork or skills, the token, the core of a pay2winner, gets 90% of the full juicyness of the game...-aaaand grinding is not as rewarding as it should be, 99% of the time you will have to research the web to look for side quests and main quests to get the xp, mowing down the monsters is very time consuming, so is the dungeon runs, so questing is the fastest process to lvl up-TRASHY and CHILDISH community, 70% are bots and silver vendors, 10% are people complaining on the current state of this game, and 20% are trolls and crappy jokesters saying arrogant and unfunny jokes on the flaws of this game not knowing and understanding how this game is managed, people think making and managing a game is easy, you are absolutely WRONG, making a game requires a lot of things to give to it to make it good, and i feel bad for the devs managing this game, a lot of issues that are major, but i believe they will get through it and end it, just be patient-the extremely annoying mechanic of a mob running away like a coward once its health is at least 10% left-current F&^KING UPDATES ARE NOTHING BUT PAY2WIN!!!!!! WHAT THE F%^K IMC!!!!!! i took a break from the game due to crap updates and the new content one is PREMIUM CURRENCY BUNDLES!!!! WORTH MORE THAN F*&KING 10$!!! usually i accept minor p2w if 10$ is the maximum of it, BUT 30$++!!! i had high hopes ever since the game was introduced, that the pay2win wouldnt be there, that the game itself at least be as good as what the LEGENDARY GAME------RAGNAROK, was.... but no.-in my suggestion, as early as now just wait for the PRIVATE SERVERS to come out, its most likely next year accdg to the people, devs in this official game is tbh not even trying, its like all they care is money, rather than making their game better and clearer and more vast, its just that i now have doubts that IMC would make it up for what the damages that already happened, well.. they will fix all of it, and the game would be at least good, but the fact that the overpowering pay2win is already there.. i just cant be lying to this overlycomplimented game, sorry, just being honestcomparison:Tree of failure                                    +more fast paced                               -most bosses are limited to quests, the field bosses are pointless, just oversized versions of the regular enemies    -each classes have fewer skills, so getting them completely requires a lot of grinding-maps and locations are narrow, and going through the quests requires a lot of movement, except when you complete it, you can teleport directly-and customization requires a lot of grinding to become exceptionally powerfulRagnarok-neutral paced, just right+LOTS of bosses to fight against, each in every field, with its own original skills and attacks+each class have a lot of skills with very small cooldowns, and is casted quicker +tons of maps, and anyone can teleport to any place to grind on, with every theme of seasons and story with events+customization is wide, lots of treasure from each quests, bosses, and monsters with good events and scenarios, and starter stat management to get a headstart on what build is preferredSo this is my opinion, im currently not recommending this game to anyone with high expectations, this game is still currently in a mediocre state, wait for all the issues to go away and the updates giving newer content than fixings. im still gonna check the game out with the hope that the pay2win restrictions would eventually disappear, then the game would be good.[EDIT]I saw the update saying it should fix most of the major issues, when I checked the gameplay, and going in crowded servers, IT STILL FEELS THE SAME! still laggy, connection responsiveness as to simply moving is still late, hit detection is still delayed, still leaving a 2nd phantom attack to legit hit when I only pressed one button to attack once... I only played once more for the free DLC, then im still disappointed, there are still botters and silver and gold sellers... most of the recent positive reviews said it should be at least smooth and nicely well made gameplay, but no, i dont see it at all, it still feels like the game i played before, nothing new... therefore im still not recommending this game at all, especially that it is still PAY2WIN when going to endgame stuffs..[RANDOM ENCOUNTER]I actually encountered a dialogue box saying ""can't find the dsetupll"" when I first installed the free dlc which opened the client the 1st time, then i  cancelled it and restarted the client for the 2nd time, then I got to the game, and it still feels the same old game with tons of major issues. Either that or that dialogue box i encountered mean't something, but i doubt it."
"fun, if your nostalgic of the old ragnarok game, be ready to plan your path, its not easy but i would be fun and rewarding journey with people u play with and builds you would make and have fun with people."
"Tree of Savior is considered by many to be a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online. I have never played RO, but if it's anything like ToS, then I can't understand why anyone was hyped for this garbage. Speaking of garbage, this game runs like I'm playing Witcher 3 at higher than ultra settings with ubersampling enabled and it's a ♥♥♥♥ing 2D game. I don't know who runs IMC, but they're asbsolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for not making the optimization of their game a priority over their cash shop♥♥♥♥♥♥ Next up is the class system. It is incredibly restrictive - you cannot respec your class advancements, and skill/stat respecs cost real money. You're not even compensated with a free respec when major balance changes are made to your build according to the forums. Topping that all off is an incredibly boring grind just to get to endgame content, but that's not really surprising considering it's a kMMO. Just remember not to put a point somewhere wrong, or advance in a terrible class, otherwise you're going to have to reroll and go through another 200 levels worth of exploding 2D sprites! Finally, it's incredibly buggy. I'm playing this crap with some friends at the moment and every cutscene freezes the other party members in place if they're too close to the player that initiates the cutscene. Apparently this bug has been a thing for more than 6 weeks and hasn't been fixed yet."
"I cannot possibly recommend this game as it actually is.The game isn't bad, per se, but... It just has its focus in a very strange place.My strongest beef against it are the several mechanical bugs and the meaningless progression.I managed to get to level 112ish and it got to a point where I'd find myself doing the same dungeon over and over again in daily (limited) quests which got old super fast...The grind becomes painful at this point for you can't progress the ''story'' since your level is too low and leveling up becomes a chore as well.This game has the same problems that many other MMOs have and, I might be wrong, the same problems Ragnarok Online had as well. However, the fun factor that RO had I cannot find it here.Maybe this game will become better with time...Perhaps its true light will be revealed if private servers become a thing?At least it's free now... but really, dedicating time for this game is more trouble than what it's worth."
"Server issues, lots of bots, restricted auction house, low quality support, broken mechanics and low quality optimization makes this game one of the most formidable belly flops since Star Wars: The Old Republic. And that's just on the P2P. I'm betting that once this games goes F2P, as intented, the real problems will begin"
"I'm slightly torn in whether i should recommend this game or not. I would lean towards not recommending it. Pros:A variation of classes which you can learn and combine to suit your play styleA good storyline with a large number of quests so you don't need to grind too muchCons:Non-existent player to player trading systemIngame market function is the worse i have ever seen.- Non-token users can only put 1 item on the market- 30% commission for non-token users which is stupid - Market upper and lower limits which tries to control the economy, tries hard but fails miserably- FPS issues- Tons of botters - A huge handicap against f2p players.  "
"Product received for freeAlright, I'll write a short review based on short hours of gameplay (first impressions are lasting)- Game lags, high pings. Even if you have low ping, the npcs themselves will lag while interacting with them. making quests uncompletable. But depending on situations you may be able to complete them, same goes with skills and stats, you may have added some stats/skills but wondered why it hasn't been applied - its lag, of course this affects anvils, storages, etc.- Game is poorly optimized. - In fact the game isn't optimized at all, you can easily get higher fps and smoother gameplay in other demanding games like FPS games, dota, Battlefield, COD, Counter Strike but this holy game have epic framerate drops which produces fps lag.- The SEA Servers [Varena + Telsiai] are kind of the most overpopulated servers and with that, Telsiai is restricting new players from joining it (in favor of Buy 2 Play early access exclusive access players) temporaily(very long temporary)Heck, you can't even access SA servers.- IMC/Developer ♥♥♥♥s up, they/the game can't have a server that handles a lot of connection like how maplestory does. Their server can't handle the greatness of how we can have a lot of maples in maple and have 0 lag.Go on and have hours of gameplay from this, I'm writing this review based on what I've experienced."
"[07/06/2017]Today was some kind of update... and yea... I think they didnt make update, they change to potato server. You cant play any more. every 10-15 sec you lag for 10-15 sec. so yea...In any other way this game is great"
"Pros: Versatile choice (YOU CAN BE ANYTHING)However, the story is too boring, and the game-play isnt impressed me. I felt just like ' this is just an ordinary game. 'I hope there will be something interesting release later. "
"Good design and mechanics.Great artwork and music.But all of these are useless if the servers and devs are♥♥♥♥♥♥ making a potentially good game unplayable due to disconnects and bugs.Edit:Seems like they recently implemented a server queue system. So the game is now playable once you get over the queue and manage to get in, but still with some amount of lag. However I feel this is still just a temporary solution, because i eventually got disconnected from the server after an hour and I had to queue again for 900 players. I queued for about 20 minutes to get in initially for 400 players, so i said ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm gonna go play another game instead of waiting for an hour. Perhaps this will dissuade a lot of players and a portion of them will quit the game, relieving the server load, we'll see how it goes from there."
"form my times playing this game, it felt like this game was built for casual the music are relaxing and it just fun to blow monsters, while running around pressing buttons without thinking. it does have problems like long que for dungoens, repetitive quests, and grindy. Btw i dont see any p2w aspect, maybe in the pvp area where they have p2w stuff, but The game is still worth a try"
"Game is literally unplayable during peak hours due to lag, ui issues. You need to pay a subscription to trade, use the marketplace, or do anything useful. There is a severe lack of mob density, and spawn rates are 10x lower than they were in beta. People were complaining about spawn rates before, so they decided to lower them again.On top of constantly ignoring their customers and making poor decisions that hamper gameplay, they're using the ""in game currency to avoid refund"" trick. If you buy any of these packages steam will refuse to refund your money even when you see the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥Great gameplay,♥♥♥♥♥♥tier execution."
"Played during the beta, and the game seemed promising, just needed some fixes and polish. Release comes along, and old issues are still present.  Chat server still lags the entire game.  Overall game lag makes the game nearly unplayable.  All sorts of limitations even with a premium membership active reduce the fun for players in an attempt to stop bots and real money transaction sellers, but they are present and spamming away in chat, leaving real players with all the frustration of bots and un-fun limitations. Gameplay is simple, yet fun.  Soundtrack is great.  the class system is wildly varied and would be a blast to play around with... you know, if the game was actually functioning the way a customer should expect a game to work. The server lag may eventually lessen as players leave, but poor developer decisions may continue beyond that to keep this game from being fun even then.  I'll keep an ear out and see if the game improves eventually, and may change this review if it does.  For now though, this game is not worth playing in the slightest."
"Previously, invested in the game, played it and even changed servers to a more populated server and abandoning my progress and investments in an older server.Week One and Two of new server: Enjoyed a week of leveling 4 characters to max or near max levels due to new events, made more money than I had on old servers and work with new friends.Week Three: Banned. Due to the company's own ineptitude and mistakes and I played like normal. Spent real life money and now I am being penalized for their mistakes. Unacceptable and laughable at how they reward those who are paying for their free to play game which thrives on people spending money on cosmetic items.. but to be honest, this is a Pay to Win game, with hard work or attempt to make progress being punished for slight errors. Even if you spent money, if you somehow fall into their honey trap of mistakes, you will be punished. Play if you enjoy an uphill battle or enjoy being denied access to a game you invested in. "
"Game is not balanced in any way. Some classes/path are just better than others.You have to pay real money or you are going to be just a scrub, there are too many limitations right now.Game is full of bots+spammers.Lag is quite bad.Developers just ignore any feedback."
"Another game with great art, music and class mechanics ruined by terrible management. The largest problem of the game is trading restrictions: free players can not trade at all and premium players are limited to 30 trades per month, furthermore once an item that isn't equipment is traded, it becomes untradable, which kills the game for merchants. The auction system isn't any better − free players are limited to one auction slot, while premium players have 5, which isn't nearly enough to sustain a healthy economy. Furthermore, there is a 48 hour delay before silver can be withdrawn from the auction house, which makes a lot of players not want to bother with it altogether.The only ones who don't deem to suffer from all of these restrictions are bots and gold sellers, for whom it is a dream come true, considering all the extra clients they're getting because players aren't able to earn silver fairly. IMC has promised to soften the restrictins, yet have done nothing of the sort for two updates. And now to make things worse Steam regional pricing has been removed without warning, making the already expensive premium currency unaffordable for the majority of players. This just continues to show that IMC don't care about their players and are only trying to grab some fast cash."
"The flood of negative reviews just because of the fact the game didn't work for ONE DAY during its EARLY ACCESS is just disgusting. Fantastic game, recommend it to everyone - both casuals and hardcores :)"
"Most of us were really excited to play this game, it promised so much during development time, but here we are...I played closed beta and it was full of bugs as any beta, so I give a try to pay to play one month before release date hopping that they would fix many of them, but they didn't so far...-None can play this game on 60+fps, even on high ending pcs;-Lots of bots and grind manipulation by them, this includes world bosses and hard to farm items;-Lag all the time on SA server, when it was located on South America skills didn't work, NPCs didn't finish actions, so they moved to North America we're we can't escape from bosses attacks because of 600ms ping;-Very, very, very expensive TPs, I would bet that this is the most expensive F2P mmo ever released;-In the beggining you feel acomplished by deafeting so many bosses everytime, but then you realise that it gets so repetitive and unworthy because they drop nothing useful to your class, most of the time they will drop a spear if you are an archer;-I know how rng works but makes no sense to grind some items that has low drop rate if you can grind mitrhil ore and sell it to buy that one which you need. It makes no sense the low drop rate for some item that will not be as good as another easier to farm;There are many other cons, but these are enough for me to quit it. It was ""good"" when I was hopping that they would fix all that, but now I gave up waiting for that. If imc fix this game, I will probably come back to give it a try... I would love to play this never-ending-beta game when it is finished."
"Before it was ok (excluding the stuttering, even if my hardware respects the requirements).Now the patcher crashes and I can't log in.I've wanted to give a second chance to the game."
"In all honesty, it’s not THAT bad. Give it a try! Take your time and enjoy the game. It’s alt friendly, so try out some different classes and combinations. Yes, the F2P model isn't the most ideal, but they’ve already made tweaks, which means they’re listening.What I don’t like about the game is not being able to spin the camera and that combat is just hack and slash (even healing). Don’t get me wrong; combat can be very fun! Sometimes positioning and timing can be tricky, and executing cross-class combinations is always fun. It’s just that sometimes it feels like I’m playing a glorified mobile game. "
"It's got problems, It needs more players, But I feel it could easily be better then Ragnarok was at peak, but the Devs gutta put more into it. I see amazing potential here. It's very playable even with it's current flaws, but so many things could be easily polished. I'll help."
"This game is good but  because of bug, hack , exploit that cause ppl leaving the game . And IMC do nothing about , slow fixing bugs , no anti bot system ,  the variety of items so bad , grinding and quest too boring , PVP system so suck , no balance at all , they do not listen to opinions of player , etc ...  , not worth playing"
"Buggest game i´ve played in my life. 1200+ hours played in this game and bored about their ""fixes and solutions"" for their bugs. I really suggest to avoid wasting your time playing this ""game""."
"Gameplay wise it's fun and engaging with over 80 different classes and a max lvl cap of 600. BUT at it's current state this game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ So many game-breaking bugs, be it quests or otherwise. Listing 1 item in the Aution house at a time is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So is waiting 48 hours for your silver to be delivered. Unless you buy a token, the Aution house feature is useless."
"Update after a year.You know, when this game came out, I had high expectations that the devs were actively working on bugs and fixing the game.  Making it something good for everyone.  I gave it a good review and a thumbs up as a fun game to play.  Yet, a year later, a simple bug complained about by AMD users is still present and still irks me to no end.  The poltergeist head.  It seems that they have made no attempts to fix anything in all these years.  I still think the game is good and it's fun to play...just don't expect the devs to do anything to fix the game or add much that isn't cash shop related."
"I like this game because it reminds me of RO. Decent graphics and game play.The cons though.. Highly pay to win game and the company will continue to alter the advantage of token to get players to get it. For players who are not getting the token: - You level slower- You get less instance entries (2 per day instead of 3)- You can only list 1 item in market place, and the item will only appear 2.5 hours after you list it- You have to farm your guts out to earn silver, so you can use it to upgrade your equipment "
"The Cons(a lot)1- Game is riddled with bugs, some quests left untranslated.2- Some features break EVERY week(chat bugs, market bugs, party system bugs)3- Lag, Laggy Lagged4- Some features are REALLY bad designed(party system throws you with people 10 or more levels higher than you and make dungeons pretty much one shot for people with lower levels, If you die in mid boss battle and they manage to score the kill you lose loot, exp and silver)5- Graphics get clunky, opening the world map lag even good machines, depending on what is on the screen can even make a GTX titan cry due to poor optimization.6- Leveling is somehow boring, with no alternatives other than questing and grinding.7- Pretty much Pay 2 Play, because key features such as interchanging items thru main/alt characters being a token feature, market fees and quantity of items are pretty much a rip off without it.8- Game pretty much doesnt know how to deal with lag(sometimes it takes forever or you don't even DC at all forcing you to manually close it), you get stuck on skill animations pretty often or the skills not even working at all.The pros1- Visually pretty2- Somehow nostalgic for Ragnarok players3- Not that difficult to play on the startNot recomended until they fix EVERYTHING that is broken(and i'm sure it will take a LOOOOOOONG time seeing their pace."
"This game might have quite a number of things that I wish they would change for the better, but overall I still find it a very enjoyable play. It's very reminiscent of Ragnarok Online. The music is superb, the models and design is cute. I enjoy the character leveling system and job system quite a lot. It's grindy, it's not something for everyone, but if a cute timesink mmo is what you're looking for with very quirky extras, this is it."
"In its current state, despite the fact its pat for EA right now, the game is a playable advert for gold sellers.  For the first 30 mins I thought the banner at the top was a constant banner for mmogold4cheapfromchina.org or something.  It was so bad it made my game drop to <20 FPS every 3 or so seconds.  After spending about 20 mins blocking the bots who were spamming I saw my FPS stable... until a few minutes later.  If you enjoy trying to outwit bots, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!  I want to like it due to the art style and class system but wow, just wow.Please try again  IMCGAMES Co.,Ltd.  I may play again and even spend money if you do not punish the player for bots actions."
"Where to start NOT to buy / play the game..? The game is said to be the 'spiritual successor' of Ragnarok online, but it's not. Though I haven't played Ragnarok a lot, the 2 games differ a lot (too much to be honest), so don't be fooled by that silly 'spiritual successor' crap...I bought this game during early access and even then the game was loaded with goldsellers - yes this pest really buys into early access games to get a market. Sadly though, the developer (and publisher) is not doing much to battle the goldsellers and you can't even report them from chat (all you can do is block them). That being said, there is said to be a tool available that can recognize, report and block this pest for you. And while it's a helpfull tool, this kind of tools SHOULD NOT be able to be used with an online game, because if this can be used, cheaters can also use hacking tools easily as well!Then the gameplay... Where to start... If you want to 'kill 10 rats' over and over again, then this game is for you. As a MMO (which is hyped to death!) it's not bringing anything new. It's the same old over and over again and a huge grind for levels to hit cap.And talking about grind... Changing jobs is yet an other grind. Yes, you can easily select what new job you want, but to get it done be prepared to do numerous 'kill 10 rats' quests before you're even able to talk to that one NPC that can help you progress to your next job.It's not all too bad though... Graphics are isometric and a very appealing anime style, sound on the other hand feels pretty much out of place for this game and story telling is pretty decent (and corny, but what to expect when almost every tale has been told already :p).In general I can say it's 'yet an other MMORPG' to fill the ranks. Nothing real special here for my taste and certainly not living up the hype (yes I did read into the game before buying that early access)."
This game isn't even CLOSE to being able to be released. Small port company can't deal with server and maintenance costs thus making the game unplayable mainly for the lag and bugs.
"If your a fan of RPG's chances are you will enjoy this game. Especially if you have played Ragnarok Online before. This game is essentially it's spritiual successor. It has some very unique features and when it becomes f2p I would suggest giving it a shot to see how you like it.Some pros and consPros+great visual style+amazing music with tons of tracks+smooth gameplay that isn't too simple or too complex to grasp+tons of options to build your character +friendly people who like to helpCons+some system mechanics need improvement (such as trading, selling items on the market)+limited on inventory space and diffucult to transfer stuff between characters (but not impossible)+while the community can be helpful also a small fraction of unhelpful players (that's any online game really)+lots of customization for character builds but choices are permanent so expect trial and error and do research (however there are skill and stat reset potions)*EDIT* IMC recently announced they are expanding item storage and updating trading mechanics*In the end, if your willing to get over some flawed system mechanics the game is absolutely worth it. These problems are mostly to fight against gold sellers and botting so it's not completely unwarranted. If it helps the ecomony then is worth it to me and they are working constantly to improve it and actually listen to feedback from the fans which is a must in a community driven game."
"TREE OF BOTS! I hate to see a good game go to ruin with staff not banning the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of bot players. I saw a bot report at forums once, guy said the player was farming for 18hrs straight staff sent a to see and didnt do♥♥♥♥♥♥ Do not use real money on this game when you can use a bot program to farm. Market prices are hell high AF because people are making millions by the hour of bot farming. This was one of the reasons why i stopped playing 7 months ago because of incompetent staff. First months of my gameplay i saw a lot of AFK farming, now even better BOT farming. You can see them ♥♥♥♥♥ at Demon Prison, Verkti Square, etc. I did try to submit a video of a player with movement pattern, I dont expect the staff woul even read bot reports.WAIT FOR A PRIVATE SERVER IF YOU WANT A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE. RAREST ITEM DROP IS 0.3%! (GMS ONLINE = 0.003%)I REGRET SPENDING MONEY ON THIS GAME"
"Its a good game, Its brings back Ragnarok in a new and better way.Look at it as a cross with Maple story (the grind for levels) + Ragnarok (the class and skill systems)Pros++-Alot of Fun classes to try out and build.-Not a very High learning curve for a MMORPG.-Skills and Attaks are pretty decent-Leveling can be fun with party or sometimes even solo-Daily Dungens that give you good expCons---The way the class system is set up can be confusing.-Once you mess a char up, There is no turning back unless you spend money or delete.-Buggy quest and controls in certain locations or to much clicking.-Poor optimaization, running at GTX 1080 8G still has FPS drops at certain areas.-Unable to rotate camera, Sometimes can obstructe your view and even block mobs/npc/players(OverAll)Over all a good game, been putting a lot of hours in it. Late game is also fun with guild wars Just like classic RO.Though this game is grindy, then again what MMORPG does not have a grind. All the more this is Free to play game.This a Grindy MMORPG where you build your character how you want to.Its Not Pay to win that i can assure you, as you can get most of the items in the game for in game SILVER.For more info ill be making an Update guide on my Up coming Youtube Channel. =D "
"If you are looking for a solid Ragnarok Online spiritual successor ; This is itIf you enjoy a good grind, numerous class choices that ARE VIABLE ; This is itArtstyle wise, people claim it's great but it's really kinda trash if you have anything beyond 20/20 and even worse if you meet that.OPTIMIZED LIKE ABSOLUTE TRASH ; Monsterous PC's will struggle, in populated town/Channels, you will lag. No ifs, no ands, no buts."
"Cons:- Bad optimization;- Full of gold sellers, the game is so bad optimized that even the gold sellers spam, drops your fps from 60 to 5. You block 1 another 3 gold seller pop up, you will spend more time blocking them, than playing;- No ingame suport, the game lacks a lot of info;- Controls are a mess... I wont even bother explaing, its just awfull.Pros:- Good animations and adicting combat;- No P2W."
"I came in to this game with high expectations as a Ragnarok fan and very disappointed after 200 hours of gameplay, the latter half of which I felt obblied to play not to abandon the friends caught in the hype I created myself.The main reason I left this game is quite simple: it's almost unviable to play this game with your friends. The game upgrading is so centered in doing unrepeatable quests, added to the high level restrictions, that playing with the same people became a frustrating battle of perfectly syncronizing your game progress with them. The last time I played I was level 121 while my friends played half a day more and were ~127 and this little level discrepancy was enough for me to feel bad to ask them to lose their time to go back to where I was. This had happened so many times before I finally realize that this game is simply not for me.Other than that, I also hugely criticize the p2w methods that IMC Games adopt and tell you if you wish to play this game competitively be ready to pay loads of real cash."
"The game itself is pretty good but this is gotta be the greediest cash shop i've ever seen in my entire life.Example: a good looking haircut costs 190tp, that's around 20$ of irl money."
"Endless grind fest. If your friends don't set aside specific times to all play together, you're likely to end up unable to party together efficiently. It's a shame because spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online had me so hyped."
"If you enjoyed Ragnarok, go right ahead. If you enjoy grindy, combat-focused games, and are willing to endure a few server problems here and there, go right ahead too.It's okay. I've heard that people that play for the time that I've played (8.7 hours so far) and actually know what they're doing (and I assume also have friends) can get somewhere around level 100 or so. I only got to level 58, but the experience was okay. I'm a lone noob, I don't mind.I got a single incredibly broken moment after being frozen by an enemy. After the freeze time ran out, my character was still stuck. I had to wait for my pet to finish the remaining foes and then go back to the character selection screen so that I may continue playing normally.This being my second day playing, I can say the South American server is mediocre. Not bad, not good, just mediocre. Today was the only day I experienced a few spikes of extreme lag, with my character suddenly appearing meters away from where she was, and everything I had done in the past seconds just being nullified. Most of the time the server functions properly. Only had one time when I got disconnected during a transition between screens. The main town lags a lot, just like Ragnarok. No crashes whatsoever. There were no game-breaking bugs either. Almost everything I experienced is functioning properly.The story is bad, just plain bad. I thought it wasn't going for a “THE CHOSEN ONE” trope until it got to a certain point where it did. You are the player, and you are the only Savior. That is, until you notice you're surrounded by hundreds of other Saviors in the main city. Whatever, we're used to this. Even if it didn't have this trope, though, it's just a terrible story. The world they built isn't as colorful and vibrant as Ragnarok's, but it gets the job done. I'd love if they took more influence from the Mana series instead of relying so heavily on Ragnarok.Gameplay-wise, it's grindy. The majority of quests are some variation on “kill monsters to get this item”. Then you use the items you got on altars, wells, ponds, whatever... a mini-boss appears (I assume those are mini-bosses, as they are so easy to kill and so ubiquitous; there's a boss every five minutes or so), you kill it, you finish the quest. You go back and receive your reward, then move to a different area. Few quests are a bit more creative. There was this quest where I had to dress as a demon, fool other demons into going to an altar, and break their souls. That's the most creative one off the top of my head so far.The game can be confusing. They barely even teach you the controls at the start, so I had to find out for myself that they were going for a QWERTY/ASDFGH/ZXC kind of thing. Being used to MMOs like ArcheAge, I was a tad bit confused at first. It's not bad, it works fine, it's just that I actually had to go to the settings to find out that Z is a normal attack, and ASD... are for skills. I wasn't able to understand the color scheme for quest markers on the map yet, and sometimes quest markers just don't show up, a weird (albeit rare) glitch.The characters are cute. I went for a Peltasta, and I was glad at first that the costume for them is quite cute. But the female version has a skirt that raises up to the goddamn sky when you walk in certain directions, revealing the character's panties. Of course, you're not forced to use the class costume, so I just went back to using the standard swordswoman one. Customization at the start is very poor. You cannot choose your character's skin tone, eye color, and not even their hair color. Colored lenses can be bought, but they don't make much of a difference. Hairstyles come with a set color that you have to change with a dye later in the game. Each dye can be acquired in a completely different manner; or you can buy them, I guess. But at least giving players a few color choices at the start would be nicer, in my opinion.Don't expect this game to have any major weight towards other areas that aren't PvE or PvP related. The markets are extremely simple, the economy is extremely simple and centralized, and there's little reason in seeking classes that aren't combat-focused in some way. As expected, this game is all about the combat. Even the social features are quite toned down. For an instance, you need to be of a class specific to the Swordsman tree (Templar) to be the leader of your own guild. I don't know who had that idea, but I think it's bad in many ways."
"This game is a big joke.I litteraly got tears rolling down my cheeks.There is no trade system between players, the only way to give an item to someone is to use the auction... But your item takes 30 minutes to 2 hours to show up...You have to pay WHEN you store item in your bank, and WHEN you withdraw items from it (it's not much money, but still...).You got to buy your teleport scrolls (which is normal), and then you got to pay to USE them...The servers are not up to the task, it keeps lagging, it didn't even actually have been released (only founders can play it for now, and I don't think it's a big part of the upcoming population).The most of my time playing this game, I was waiting for it to load... When I got my class level 15 as a magician I had the possibility to ""evolve"", and I decided to become a pyroman. So I had to teleport to a house (LOADING), take the quest, get out of the house (LOADING), get in another house (LOADING) and kill two monsters, teleport back to the first house (LOADING) to finish the quest, and then get out of the house (LOADING) to teleport at the sanctuary (LOADING) and finally get in action (but I wasn't able to teleport to the right level of the dungeon and had to walk deeper which means MORE LOADING).And it's not even like the loadings are fast, no, they often took more than 1 minute to complete (I don't have the best computer, but I was expecting this game to have a well optimization given the look of it).There is so much more to say... Freezes, game crashing without any reason...So, I would rate this game 4/10 at most. I really wouldn't recommend you buying it. If you really want to try it, you should wait for it to release free to play next month.EDIT= I would like to apologize to my friend who will recognize himself. I shouldn't have let you offer me this game."
"I don't understand why a lot of people have problems with the current game system. I guess the gaming population has become too spoiled that they want to be spoonfed all the time with the features that's only beneficial to them.ToS is a great game. Unlike what other people say, this is nothing like RO - far from it. ToS has an identity of its own but due to tons of existing MMORPGs, definitely some concepts have been embedded on how the game is played (even the skills have some resemblance to existing games). If there's any flaw I see, it would be their servers but I willing to let that go for now since the game has been officially around for less than a month. Objectively speaking, its lack of 1:1 trade has become a deal breaker to some players but they must understand that until the management has figured out how to fix stabilize the economy naturally (w/c I'm pretty sure they're working on), we should expect stringent rules. So far, IMC has been proactive so I'm not even worried that they won't deliver. If they don't, it's easy to leave the game -- obviously.I'm not going to comment a lot on the gameplay, it's refined and the class system is just so versatile. It's grindy but it adds a sense of accomplishment everytime your character reaches a certain milestone.I'm definitely going to recommend the game to my friends but honestly, I won't encourage them to buy the early access packs since it does not give players any real advantage besides leveling up ahead.Everything's great except some features which I think are non-factor. Those people who keep on whining should think first on the implications of the existing game system before leaving their judgement which I see is just too focused on the negatives. I was going to write some more but unfortunately it's game time. See you in-game!"
"Well now, here's my piece of a tale called ToS:Found out about the game today during job time, price seemed kind of fair(regional pricing was on at the moment), decided to buy once I'm home...Price went up 3.5 times. No news, no announcement, discreet answers on official forums only, which took some time to find.That was a bad move. You're ""fighting bots"" via checking their looted amounts of TP and denying access to the game? That's a strange, harmful way to ""fight bots"". You fight such behaviour in a way that won't inconvenience customers, instead of ""oh ok we won't implement anything, let our analytic department do the work for the time being"".Honest truth as a conclusion: I'm salty af right now. Because I've spent 5 hours thinking how it's gonna be a great time to play good ol' RO and build up my cleric when I come home, instead finding a rushed bad decision basically slicing that good feeling to shreds. I still want to play the game, but I really find the idea of paying 50$ to the people who made such a marketing blooper in bad taste.I would still recommend the game to others from what I've managed to see over the shoulder, but just can't bring myself to support company with such decisions atm."
"--■ If you liked Ragnarok Online, chances are high you will like Tree of Savior■ Work-in-progress issues, but those had other MMOs as well■ Great fun for a free to play game, endgame raids, pvp, gvg■ Everything farmable, even Premium-- 8/10"
"I expected a Ragnarok Online 2.0.I got something different, but that's not a bad thing.Not going to lie, there's a lot that can be changed, but IMC listens and implements the players' good ideas.The only things I want right now are server stability and general bug fixes. Those are the only issues that I have with it.There are other things that I don't generally agree with, such as trading restrictions, the auction house wait to retrieve your earnings, and the small guild size limit, but they haven't impacted me too much.I recommend that you give it a try."
Very unforgiving game for newcomers and people who have not spent time to do research on the classes they want to play. Should allow more flexibility towards skill point distributions for PvE and PvP which should not cost real money and class selections.
"Getting really better. I can see the improvements happening from when I first played up to now. They're doing their best. It's really a good game. First time I played it, it was barely playable. Insane lag, missing npcs, missing quest, massive drop in fps and now well, I can honestly say that it has gotten better."
"We got 35 ish players queuing for mission during prime time. The queue for low level dungeons usually takes about 1-2 hours. With the current population the devs should have come up with a new group finding system with level scalling long time ago. Even without such system, they should let people helping each other to clear dungeons. But with the daily limits of dungeon entries it's impossible to get any help from a friend outside your level range. In short, this game is dead for new players without a level scalling system."
"Pros:Simple, familiar.  What you see is more or less what you get, and it's not hard to figure things out.Comprehensive built-in completionist support.Fairly varied class and playstyle options.Individual players can be very eager to be social and party.It really is F2P, early access aside.  People complaining about certain restricted features ignore the fact that buying access for a month with game cash is relatively cheap to anyone playing regularly.Cons:No PVP.  Future PVP will be unbalanced and have severe level requirements.Does not respect your time in terms of levelling, you will never be able to try very many aspects of the game for yourself.Full of half-measures for controlling bots and goldsellers.Community makes the same cancerous, preteen jokes all day.Classes scale harshly- your super-fun playstyle may not work at all at high level if you neglect classes that literally unlock later.Overall:It's fine.  A pretty standard package.  It really is a streamlined RO, regardless of what some hipsters say.  Differences include less loot and collectible diversity, more class diversity, and steeper level scaling in terms of overall power."
":/ Waited one month for the F2P server and they don't released it on the 28 april. And by writing it only in forum is a nice idea, that the F2P server will be someday in may ... and in may they will write it someday in 2016 and so on ...Why not saying it on news, so that the people would know."
"Greetings folks,this will mostly be an appolagy letter towards my guild members.though this will most likely provide some points for other players as well.1st of all, i'm sorry guys for quiting the game.after 300+ hours of trying to get templar it kind of started to tax on me. specially the last levels of trying to get towards templar was tedious and yes i know i wasnt the quickest to reach iti'm sure there are quicker ways to get rank 7 yet that wasnt me.but after finally reaching templar things were looking up for a while.i was happy when i finally obtained the guild, gained some fun members. and had a good time socializing with others.alas this was just a short bliss as about a week after i started to learn how empty of a shell the guild system actually is.it misses most if not all of it's features. and even then it lacked allot of stuff.-no functional guild storage system.-no functional guild events.-no officer system-no taming system-barely functional farming system-no neutrality system-no indication of guild member levels so grouping up was hard to do-no guild tower tp (how are members supose to go to a guild tower if they cant reach it-expencive guild tower placement (100k) so if you misplace it, it would cost 100k more.a bad upgrade system. (3 upgrades with bad options, taming not ingame, farming only 1 out of 6 possible seeds were available and +1 member cap per guild level)i was quite demoralized after i realized how much the guild system was lacking, i ended up making a new character in the hopes of having more fun. but in the end i never really got the feeling of ""fun"" my only goal in the game was getting the guild. now don't get me wrong i would most likely have played allot more if the guild had a good system but that didnt seem to be the case.but it wasn't just the guild system that was bad.the dungeons in this game were tedious, no real inovation in them. playing as a tank it felt like i was just taking the hits hoping i would not die. the mobs just didnt die quick enough. hell tbh the mobs were stronger than the bosses in most dungeons. and tbh that was the sad part about most of the dungeons. i never felt like any of the dungeons were fun.comparing it to aura kingdom(AK) or ff14 dungeons all mobs, bosses and area's were bad. in AK and FF14 it felt like you were tanking. in this game? well lets just say it didnt feel like any of that.when i started that new character i quickly came to the realisation that the only way to play the game anymore since launch was to ks ks and ks. hoping to get the exp while people run amok. it wasnt fun to play. even knowing were to go didnt speed things up.finally at launch i expected them to finally add propper things to the TP shop, well lo and behold. they added nothing.in the i think 2 months i was playing this game they added 1 set of costumes that were all PINK. yes i'd love to see my warrior in pink. i really do. (sarcasm)the fact that after choosing a class i wasnt able to change it ever forces you to go with other characters for other builds.the chat system was so tedious that half the time whisper chat didnt work. matter a fact everything in this game was just a shell of what it could have been.i must say after a total of 420+ hours of playing this game. i never really felt great playing it.i hoped for the game to get more fun when i finally had a guild to play it with. but even that was just an illusion of my imagination.anyway, with this last review of the game i leave the game behind me.thank you for reading and maybe in the future this game might be worth looking at again.for now,this was Rogue_Wolfaka FancoreSigning off "
"The game is great (I mean the core aspects of it) and I still think there is still a lot of potential in it.But I won't lie that right now we are in need of some changes, but I'm hopeful that IMC will deliver them to us, even if takes some months/a year from now on.Still would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid/different MMO experience. (like those old MMOs we used to play)Just take it easy and be there for the ""long term"" instead of looking at the faulty ""short term"" we got right now."
"While Tree of Savior has problems that would justifiably turn players away, the rapid improvement, core mechanics and various other positives has made this game one of my all time favourites. I recommend trying it out, or at least watching as it progresses."
"There is a lot wrong with this game right now, for sure. IMC, the developers, or whoever, need to communicate more openly with the community. The negativity is very strong right now, and for good reason. If you guys don't respond to the community and make it known that you KNOW there are big issues plaguing this game and that you want to fix them, people are just going to keep shouting louder. People desparately want this to be the great game they know that it can be.At the core, I know this is a solid game. I was home from work today and was able to play during a low-traffic time, and it was amazing. I was able to connect everytime I tried, the lag was minimal, and I didn't get booted once. This is why there is a such a strong influx of negativity - because people care about the fate of this game. It sounds silly, but it's true! If the game itself didn't have anything to it, it would just quietly die off. For a bit of perspective for those of your just now checking this game out: When it was still in closed beta testing, it had a 9/10 rating. Scrolling through the recommendations was a sea of thumbs up. We're in an ""early access"" period now, and the community expects better performance, or at the very least, better communication. All in all, I'm still recommending this game. If you like the art style, if the gameplay looks appealing, and especially if you were a big RO fan and are looking for a ""fresh"" spiritual successor, then by all means, buy in. I would strongly suggest you go for the $10 pack, as the two more expensive tiers offer items and incentives that are difficult to make the best use of right now due to the game's performance issues. If you're reading any of these reviews IMC, please understand that the negativity isn't because we want the game dead. We just honestly want to see it survive, and we want you to show us that you want it to survive, too. TL;DR: The game itself is great, and has the potential to be awesome. People are lashing out because they understand this, but IMC is not giving us the confidence right now that they're going to see it through and give the game the treatment it deserves.Oh, and the music is awesome. At least in my opinion.EDIT: Updating my review to say I quit the game a couple of months ago. I had a fun time, and I still stand by my recommendation - I think if you're interested, it's worth a shot. It might not keep you interested forever, but it's alright."
A MMO game that has no idea what it is because of reworks and balancing...over and over again.A RNG upgrading weapon/armor system to burn away all your hard earned money.A playerbase of two thousand less players (mostly bots).A game where exploring areas (contents) is useless because you can power level in a map and skip about 40+ over areas so...what's the point of having those again ? just extra stats ? 
"Edit: as I edit this. IMC announced 50% discount for Founder's pack on 21st April 2016Ok to begin with:Don't get me wrongI love this game but I can't recommend to anyone.At least not rite now.Well..to make it short(haha)There are some pros:Class - u can advance ur class on certain levelGrind - a lot of grind brings back old school mmo. Oooh such a memory. Oh who thinks grind is a bad thing... STAY away from TOS.Stat - u can build ur own character without to follow any guide. There are few more. U can find it in the game. Try it when it goes F2P. If u want to.When it comes to bad things:I've played so many mmo, but TOS got the worst trading system with the restriction and etcMarket- is meh. Can improve the systemTrade? - You can't even trade ur silver(game currency) with ur other characters on the same account.The restrictions are to prevent bots and silver seller. Or so they saidThere are also penalties when u trade itemsThe restriction and limitation are to prevent bots and gold sellers(silver)So,now u can't see any silver seller.No bots in the game.Trust me.There are no Spammers who sell silver...HahaRestrictions everywhereOh forgot. I used token.Wait. Still restriction everywhereI'll not recommend this game to anyoneNot at this state. NoP/S: Please don't judge my grammer. Im not ur gramma"
"Simply put, Tree of Savior is fun as hell and it isn't a clone of World of Warcraft.Now then, allow me to elaborate.First of all, the music is phenomenal. The tracks are well composed, diverse, and beautiful. If that isn't enough, each area generally has multiple tracks so that you aren't listening to one song on repeat which is a really nice touch that most developers overlook.Secondly, the graphics. While not hyper realistic or over the top, the graphics of Tree of Saviour are an interesting blend of 2D sprite components and 3D cell shading that create a gorgeous artistic style that can still be run by lower end machines.Next, even at low levels, your skills feel powerful. Your moves have nice flashy animations that are impressive, and monsters explode on death making huge group kills ever so satisfying. Bosses are fun and interesting, scaling in challenge as you level up and progress through the story.Moving on, the questing experience is different from other games. The NPCs that provide you with side-quests are often unmarked, so for the first time in a game in years I found myself talking to all the NPCs in an area. I learned about my surroundings, found a ton of extra quests, and enjoyed the exploration / interaction aspect that this deisgn choice creates. I do understand though that this aspect of the game isn't for everyone, so it is definitely something to be aware of.The Cash Shop is purely costume and convenience items and steers clear of a Pay to Win environment. In fact, most of the Cash Shop items that matter at all are tradeable like the Premium Token, Tree of Savior's subscription equivalent.Character customization may seem scare at character creation, but when you realize that the vast majority of the character customization options are both toggleable and available from the Market, Achievements, and the Class System, the lack of options during Charaction Creation kind of ceases to matter.The Class and Statistic Systems are intense. There are over 80 Classes in the game and there are a boat load of combinations that you can build. You assign your stat points too, giving you complete control over your character.The amount of options you have to control your character are fantastic. Want to use a Keyboard to do everything? You can. Not a fan of Keyboards and want to use your Mouse for everything? You can do that too. You like kicking it old school and want to lean back and use a Controller? Well, that's also an option. Want to switch between them? The game will just swap on the fly. You could drop your Controller and break it mid boss fight, and just start playing with the Keyboard if you knew your keybinds. That's awesome, cause Mouse and Controller batteries always seem to die at the worst times.Finally, if you played the original Ragnarok Online, Tree of Savior feels like coming back to your house from an extended vacation. Things are familiar, you have to get used to them again, but above all, you're back home.I would highly recommend this game. Haters gonna hate, I'm gonna play Tree of Savior.Thanks for reading! Have a good one, and if you're gaming, may all your loots be phat!Z"
"Worst launch I have ever witnessed. Early Access is more like Alpha of an Alpha. Such basic bugs exist one has to question that this game isn't just another modern day but equally outdated coded game. I suggest not paying a cent to these fools that have created/invested/pushed this game. IF it ever becomes remotely playable, and IF the producers/develoepers ever truly make some reasonable decisions then it might turn around. As of now, it's not worth your time folks."
"""release on april 28"" im trying to get in on april 30 and still free to play is locked, dont offer something you are not delivering,  besides the huge dissapointment of the bad comments about trading and even limited grinding"
"I'm someone who played Ragnarok since 2004 and stopped last year because the game is basically done. Tree of Savior is definitely what RO2 should have been like and not the abomination of the game that it actually was. Lots of the negative reviews of this game focus on stuff that isn't the fault of the actual game or it's content and is instead the fault of IMC Games; things like too many bots that aren't banned, really laggy servers, and the awful way they set up the auction house and treated their community. This is valid negative feedback of the game overall but I'm much more interested in the game's systems such as classes and leveling.- Classes and SkillsLots of classes to choose from, almost too many, you get to choose between Archer, Cleric (has healer classes), Swordsman (has tank classes), and Wizard class trees. These trees have 13 different classes to choose from that you unlock as you level and all of them have different skills. There are also a handful of hidden classes in each tree that you can access by doing special hidden quests. Most classes can also be chosen twice or thrice as you progress through your leveling which unlocks further skills and skill buffs for that class if you like the class that much and really want to commit to it. Each class you choose also comes with a unique cosmetic costume that you can swap out for each other any time. I only have experience with the Archer tree at the moment and I was planning on turning it into a Rogue later down the class tree but I spent too many skill points in a particular skill that I should be spamming and so I run out of mana quite often. Ragnarok had a skill system where you could select which level of the skill you want to cast and this game doesn't have that so if I continue playing I'll have to play IMC to reset my skills eventually. It's very easy to screw up your character if you don't know what you're doing by putting a skill or status point in the wrong place, so do your research and make sure you know where all your points going before you start.- Leveling and ExplorationThis is one of the most beautiful worlds in this type of game I've seen in a long time and combined with the BGM it easily gives me flashbacks of Ragnarok in it's prime. In Ragnarok you would explore the world while killing monsters wherever you went, however in this game you level mostly by questing on appropriately leveled maps and receiving EXP cards that you can redeem at a later time if you wish. You get experience from monsters too but it's only optimal to grind them at certain levels and the most optimal way to use your EXP cards is at certain levels as well. In Ragnarok (before Renewal at least) you could just kill any monster and it would give you the same amount of experience and the well-populated and expansive maps meant you could farm them the whole way to max level. I feel many players liked this because you could set your own goals; you could grind your levels all night or simply a level or two a day. Tree of Savior doesn't really facilitate that because you're almost always just plodding along through endless and sometimes pointless quests without the sense that you've achieved much. This was the big turn-off for me as it made the game seem boring and I just wasn't having fun after a while. Even going back to grinding professions in WoW or skills in Runescape ended up being more fun because they have better structured reward systems.- SummaryThis game falls into the trap of the newer generation of MMOs where they try to ape other games instead of coming up with their own creative gameplay. Tree of Savior is like someone awkwardly put WoW's questing system and Ragnarok's class and skill systems in a room together and forced them to make a baby. The result was a more lame version of both. The art, music, and characters in the game are truly beautiful but that can only carry the game so far before you notice the gameplay flaws. I got bored of it because it failed to capture my attention. Will I be back? Possibly, but I've already quit games like GW2 and SWTOR for much the same reason. They try to recapture the feel of the MMOs of old in their heyday but ultimately fail. What they should be doing is trying to make a new heyday with new and creative ideas."
I realy like this game.Pro:-awesome art -awesome music-relaxed gamesplay-i like the gameplay-number of classes and builds(-unique class balance and progression system)Cons;(-unique class balance and progression system)-current token system-limited dungeons
"I get happy to boot this game up.  Somehow I'm excited about roleplaying a violent barbarian killing ferret soldiers.+ Pros:   Boob art is gratuitous, they're always abundant, firm and overflowing.    Good music is always a plus, Klaipeda's got that Prontera vibe going on.   Job System/Stat allocation/Hard choices make me hard   Many ""Hnnngh"" moments. Crits: Hnngh. Level up: Hnnngh. Got a priest in my matchmaking: HNNNNGH.   Online Skill Calculator + Cons:    Modern-day whine machines we call gamers   Chat Filter   Bots. I accept them, but hate them.    Bosses are mostly just giant sand-bags with teeth.   Why do I drop my gems when I die? Why does the game not tell me this? That was important game."
"Fun experience, flows nicely, doesn't feel too difficult at the start and lets you get a handle of the class system fairly easily. You may have to re-level your character if you mess up harshly -- or use a skill reset potion. But that is the danger (And re ward) of a complex system such as this. Highly enjoyable and I reccomend anyone try it when it goes F2P, or slam down a payment to play it early.Will refine my review the further I get into the game."
"This game won't appeal to all mmo fans, but damn is it an addictive time. The visuals and music are amazing, the sound design is top notch, the combat's satisfying, and the devs really do listen. Very recently, on the day of this review posting, IMC announced their plans for optimization. They went very in-depth into what they were doing and what they plan to do, including multi-core usage and server improvements. This shows they really do listen. (You can find this blog post on their main website)I will say it can get a bit grindy, but again, that all comes down to personal preference. I personally enjoy a little grind, it's somewhat relaxing, I get to listen to some tunes, and that little bit of improvement feels pretty neat.  "
"To be honest i can understand some negative reports we see here, but not these many. Game has awesome art, great music, nice character progression, a wide path for classes, never gets boring. Game is grindy, but everyone already knew this, it's korean after all, nothing to be surprised. Game suffers right now of Dungeon issues when trying to join, a really poor economic system, as you can't trade(IMC said they are working to let people trade without tokens), can put only 1 item in AH without a token(5 otherwise), can't directly trade silvers. I don't think this game will be a ""ghost town"" after 1 year as someone said, i think IMC will be able to improve and hopefully listen to their players.For now, i can say this is a good game, with some issues, but with a great potential to be the real RO2. Hope in IMC!"
"Everyones gonna ♥♥♥♥♥ about the weapons being given out to random people, them being unfair, pay2win, blah blah blah. Listen.The game is enjoyable is you play casually, hardcore, or you're a ♥♥♥♥ing whale who buys everything. Regardless, you don't NEED to pay, you just NEED to have fun and grind.Sure, the weapon♥♥♥♥♥♥was kind of stupid, but whoopdy do 12 people got it instead of the 5 that were farming it. Relax, if you're already grinding for the weapon, you've already invested so much time into the game so you have to enjoy it, no point in being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over the weapon you're farming when you enjoyed the game up until the point. Stupid, but yea.Deff worth the download."
"RO lovers rejoice! You'll feel right at home in ToS so stop reading now and start playing! For those who have never dabbled in RO, much fun can still be had whether you choose F2P or premium. Quite a bit of negativity going around lately but just keep in mind that it is still early days so of course improvements will be needed. Despite that, I've had a very positive and enjoyable experience so far and I don't see that changing anytime soon.The devs are also constantly taking the voice of the community into account when releasing their frequent updates. The most recent update will alleviate the complaints on trading and team storage restrictions that you've all read about. If they continue on this path (I've witnessed no signs at all that says otherwise) then ToS will only get better and better.Pros:-Gorgeous art. Very unique in a saturated genre.-Fluid combat system that works great with a gamepad.-Tons of class choices (around 80) and even more are planned.-Stat points to customize your unique (or cookie cutter) build to your liking, leading to many different play styles.-Pleasant soundtrack.-Dev team that is adamant on fighting bots and gold sellers.-In-game bot reporting system complete with rewards and punishment for abusing the tool.-Cash shop pay to win aspect is extremely minor so far. Mostly cosmetics.-Good amount of crafting available.-F2P. Premium token can be acquired with in-game currency, which has been fairly easy to accomplish thus far if you know what you're doing (a few days grinding for your average low to mid level players, even less if you're higher level or skilled).Cons:-Needs optimization. Very sluggish in crowded areas, especially main cities even though you may have a boss PC.-Very linear quest system. Only a problem when you decide to make a few characters.-Price of premium (~$18 USD) is very expensive even when compared to AAA titles and their subscriptions.-Some premium token features (team storage, less restricted trading) are available as standard in most other games.-The sheer amount of classes can be punishing if you take a misstep somewhere along the line so plan wisely.-Low spawn rates (although this is always subject to change).-Huge item market selling tax without premium token (30% vs 10%).-48 hours to retrieve silver after selling item in market (to fight gold sellers)."
"From the looks and sounds the game is great. However the company is worse than nexon... They are delaying the game about another 2 weeks to a month. And put the early access packs on sale for 50% off to try and juice even more money. I orginally had a lot of hype for this game it looked fun and good. But now i am turned off and will probably stay away from this game. The toxic company behind them are really something to be avoided. Plus not to mention the countless restrictions in place that really ruin the game for both free to play and buy to play players. Perfect example of a game ruined by the greed of man.Just stay away from this. Until they better themselves and have some self control, disgusting."
"I would NOT recommend it to anyone that has played 2d platformers or 3d platformers like ragnarok online. It is no longer a very promising and decently fun/time-consuming game.Pros Interesting variety of jobs(classes) that have an effect on your character later on in the levels A LOT of levels and maps Good-decent graphical detail and sound effects. Music must be turned on in this game, it is good Active developer feedbackNeutrals Akin to a grinding korean game, however quests are lined up everywhere. You will only encounter a few bumps that will require grinding some zones Auction house, marketplace setup is similar to maplestory/ragnarok's. Nothing special, but important to be decent enough. Storyline is something that would come out of a JRPG or final fantasy in general. Don't expect to have feelings. You are the main hero, 'the chosen one' and yadda yadda Not enough variety in jobs. Yes, it was a pro because it was a breath of fresh air from other things because they make sure you have to use spells you've learned early on, but per job rank-up you only get two options each time. Sure, you do rank up a lot of times, but variety would be lovely. Contradictory to this, it will be hard to balance ( see any MOBA ) therefore this belongs in neutral and not consCons Unbalanced, seeing from closed beta 2. It's expected, but took away from joy due to swordsman overtaking absolutely everything Community has attracted most of 4.c.h.a.n. and reddit's attention. NOT a good thing. Good for publicity but a lot of people will need to be permabanned. However, it is good that this is on steam, as bans here can be permanent on a profile, and repeat offenders could potentially be tracked and have their main accounts removed. Few visible ways to support the developers through a ""cash shop"" - e.g., cosmetic items. If this turns into a pay 2 win game, I will not recommend this game.Massive con See what I said at the end of the cons? It turned pay2win. You can't trade unless you buy their form of currency with real money. Things are limited and unfair. $18/month subscription - I'd rather play WoW if I wanted a heaping pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND I'd play it at a discount of $3. "
Raising price to US dollar instead of using regional pricing before discount because apparently to American players all non US citizen= bots.and dont bother to address this to the forum because you will be futher bombarded by bunch of kids calling your poor idiot etc.
"Absolutely amazing, i've been waiting for an MMO to fill the gap that Ragnarok Online left behind and after YEARS of searching ToS seems to do the trick. Amazingly unique, fun gameplay, PLENTY of content, and a super cute art style. This game finally has it all. I really can't even find something to complain about. Check it out! I'm confident you'll enjoy it!"
"After leveling a character to 150, I feel this game is in noway ready for release. It is littered with bugs, server lag, poor design choices and a lack of variety and content past level 120ish. Pros:+fantastic art style - this looks very unique compared to it's modern counterparts while at the same time feels familiar to anyone who has played ragnarok online+satisfying combat - combat feels fast and fluid and attacks have a very satisfying feel upon useCons:-Server lag/crashes - when you are limited to 2 dungeon runs a day and the exp gained contributes a signficiant part to leveling, it is stupid for the instance to crash and boot you out while consuming a daily dungeon run-Horrible way to counter gold sellers/botters - gold sellers and botters are still rampant and doing a google search on gold sellers, it is easy to tell that all the measures this game has in place hasn't worked. On the down side, it is terrible for actual players. Non paying customers can only trade playing customers but any traded item becomes character bound (destroys resale value once you outlevel your gear). You can't trade money to anyone - friends included. Auction House allows only 1 item listing for non playing customers with a 30%  AH fee (10 items with 10% ah fee for paying customers). You can only collect money from the AH after 48 hours.-Lack of content for progression past level 120 - unless you count endlessly grinding mobs for 0.01% or doing daily dungeons as content. Current max level is 250 - 300 so there is a huge grind wall ahead...-Dungeons become painfully long and repetative - dungeon design is uninspiring and only worth doing a handful of times but most people go for full clears not because it is fun but because of the vital exp needed to continue the grind-Though it is free to play the game is severely gimped without a subscription. It becomes impossible to meaningful play the AH without a subscription. For a grinder, efficiently killing things is ontop of the list of priorities but withouyt a sub your character moves significantly slower and receive 30% less exp -Character stats cannot be reset as of today and while skill points can be reset - job changes are fixed. As such, without a lot of prior research, there is a very likely chance that you will need to reroll if you want to play something that is decent.Overall, this game starts off being alot of fun with it's nice visuals and initially fun combat but soon devolves into your standard korean grinder. Implementation feels old and dated (something from 10 years back) and the sad thing is...there was no reason to make it as bad as this. Taking queues from say GW2 - you don't have to gimp non premium player progression - just add alot of visually pleasing cosmetic goods in the cash shop. IMC didn't need to lock down trade features so heavily to try and prevent botters. Worst of all, there was no reason to make the grind wall as severe as it is...The game has an enormous set of classes and builds to try, I would much rather play a variety of different classes and builds rather then grind a single character ad infinitum."
Recommended someway only when regional server are fully installed at respective area.Some restricted might lose some group of player but it wont break the game though.Current issue other than high latency from SEA region was botter and silver seller. 
"Brutally Charming.Let's tackle some of the issues players have been having with the game, And some of the misleading reviews, and then let's go on to discuss briefly the actual state of the game as a whole.MicrotransactionsPeople seem to be very upset with the microtransaction system in place, limiting the features of the game.  This is misleading.  The tokens that give your account premium for 30 days are purchasable through the Auction House in game and are extremely affordable currently.  The Current Cost of a monthly premium token on the Auction House : 500kThe problem arises in that there are still restrictions even with the monthly token. Are they annoying, yes.  Will it cost you money to unlock premium?  Not at all.Server Maintenance/Lag IssuesI've been playing MMO's long enough to know that stepping into the grind day one is not the wisest decision.  Every night I receive several rewards in game, and problems get fixed.  It happens.  Personally the biggest problems that friends and myself have encountered so far have already been fixed, but there are some issues that absolutely need to be fixed in the near future, and that I have no doubt will be.  Nothing I would consider game breaking.  Side Note : they have also added two new brand new servers for different world locations since release.  Work is getting done.Disappointing?  Yes.  Overall?  Expected.A Warning to New PlayersDo not start in Orsha.  No matter what. I'll be blatently clear about this, This area is unfinished, unpolished, and requires a steadily more intense amount of grind, even including an area from 40-60 where there just simply seems to be zero quests, and nothing to help push you through.  Start in Klaipeda.  The storyline is well polished, satisfying, has many more rewards than the Orsha side, and doesn't brick wall you on your quest to level 300 nearly as often.  Do not confuse this with the server also named Orsha,  I am strictly speaking of the starting city options during character select.Performance1. The client needs to be restarted entirely every few hours, I would say 4 is a nice round number to be safe.  Load times can significantly increase as memory does ableit slowly.2. The game crashes sometimes.  Thankfully it takes a whopping 4 seconds to boot to menu. 3. I get consistantly excellent frames 30-80 during game, and unlike most modern games, your frames do not directly impact the visual appeal or performance of this game in any fundamental way.  It is however extremely noticeable in cities where population can be absurdly high at times.4.  No matter how hard my internet chokes, burps, deflates, or otherwise acts up, I stay connected to the game and can resume my gameplay without being punished for it. (This may mean a lot to some of you, I thought you should know.)Current State of the Game/My personal ReviewThis game is a diamond in the rough.  It's a beautiful, and sometimes brutally charming isometric styled grind em up that wants to be played.  The controller support is excellent, my couch can attest to that, And I don't have to think too much about what I'm doing.  I just like to sit back and explode all the things, and so far I keep getting rewarded for my behaviour and I can appreciate that in a game.  I keep getting these deep Diablo feels, and the game keeps reminding me of its FFT/RO inspirations.  The game is unfinished, put simply.  But I don't seem to mind.  I've been disappointed, engaged, surprised, I've muted the music only to unmute it later, finding that I enjoyed it in the backround.  I've raised a pet by force feeding it silver until it now succesfully headbutts things at the speed of smell.   Ultimately there's a lot I would do to change this game to what I want it to be.  But it's not my game, I'm just here to play it.  And I've been enjoying that so far.  For all my disappointment in it not being the next Tactics Game, It does a lot of things right.  And it keeps it simple, from the gui and large easy to read buttons, to the immediateness of slapping a controller in my palm and booting the game up in just a few seconds.  It's more of a sequal to Maple Story, minus the socialite nonsense.  You just get to look cool, be what you want to be, and kill thousands of monsters.  And that's just what I signed up for."
"With more than 1000+ hr of me playing this game.The good thing is that the game sound track is nice, but there're so many issue ingame that still didn't fix.1. Many Bot in low level.2. Bugs, many bug out there, and new bugs coming every time server maintenance.3. skills balance of each class is very poor.4. end game content is so little to nothing, even quest is no more when lv more than 240+5. lower ppl playing each day.6. lag"
"**I have played this game in iCBT 2 (I think it was 2) and I have watched enough streamers to know what I am talking about**Edit: Spruced up review a little, fixed a couple of grammatical mistakes that I missed. Improved clarity of some parts. Prefaced my F2P experience with my iCBT experience.I wanted to like this game, I really, really really did. I've been waiting for months for it to come out for F2P, I watched Etup grind for hours on his stream, basking in the huge variety of classes (like one class that can plant grass, friggin grassplanter support dude...) and hyping me and some friends up for it for the longest time.And it only took two days before we got completely fed up with the bullsh*t.Now, I didn't get all too frustrated when I was playing iCBT, I was gunning for the Alchemist class (which is probably a mistake, fair warning) but was stuck on Tenet Chapel at around Level 35~40 because I didn't have any leveling guides at the time. I fell into the same ""trap"" that I will explain later on in this review. There was nothing to tell me that I could have gone to the Orsha side of the map after starting on Klaipeda.Further, I was experiencing a HUGE problem with MP consumption. I was nearly bankrupted all the time because of how much I had to spend on MP potions and how I have to chug them constantly. Again, without some sort of leveling guide to tell me that spellcasters who love to spam spells should heavily prioritize SPR over INT (and maybe get some CON for solo survivability but I was doing that anyway).First of all, lets look back at the catastrophe that was the Closed Beta. It was a bit of a lagfest then and apparently IMC didn't get the memo that it was time to beef up their servers in anticipation of the huge influx of players that would come on F2P release. They didn't do a damn thing except release a 2nd SEA server. There are STILL too few channels in critical maps and STILL too many channels in spots people will breeze by or not even smirk at.Second we have how awful it is to party sometimes. All of you are on the same quest, but when one of you turns in that quest and it just so happens to lead into a boss fight immediately with no warning, your friends are pulled into your instance, and upon beating the boss, there's a very good chance that you will have to fight that same boss again (and again depending on how many are in your party) so your friends can complete their quests, because I'm sure it's because you didn't coordinate turning in the same quest at the same time and waiting before moving onto the next part. It's still bullsh*t that this is even a thing. Don't force people into boss fights upon accepting a quest.Next we have spawn rates, amount of mobs, and drop rates and how, when these factors are tied with how many people need a certain mob for something. The spawn rates are absolutely abysmal in most areas. The quest mob needed for the Hoplite advancement in Tenet B1? Takes roughly 2 minutes to spawn.Everyone knows this. Everyone has complained about this on the forums as far back as Closed Beta. And yet IMC doesn't do anything about it.The amount of mobs needed for quests (even critical advancement quests) are too few and sometimes the spawn rates are abysmal to compensate for this issue. The quest mob for the Hoplite advancement? There are only two of them, period.Everyone knows this. Everyone has complained about this on the forums about it. IMC doesn't do anything...Then when you add in a *chance* for a quest item to drop on these mobs that are too few and take too long to spawn, you're adding salt to the wound and giving a big middle finger to the players (especially some Swordsmen advacement quests). The Hoplite advancement? Yep, you guessed it. That mob that takes a long, long time to spawn and are too few and far between... has a *chance* to drop his quest loot.Everyone knows this. Everyone has complained about this on the forums about it. And IMC hasn't done a d*mn thing about this.Now lets talk about the one thing that is probably on everyone's mind:How bad is the grind?It can get bad. Really bad. Back to what I said during my iCBT experiences, about how I didn't have any leveling guide on-hand and thought it was a good idea to pop your Level 3 (and up) EXP Cards instead of saving them to skip past the grind spots, well, if you did that... you're in for the ride of your life, because good luck kid, you're gonna be stuck grinding in a known ""horrible grinding spot"" that the people who wrote those leveling guides compel you to skip past.And even still, when you hit the higher levels (200+), most of your time will be spent grinding quite a bit per day just to hit one or two levels (and I'm talking 10-15-ish hour sessions).Now most people won't mind this, it's not like Dungeon Fighter where there's a Stamina system in place, and there's nothing to pressure you into leveling in a certain amount of time, but I would want the leveling and grinding experience to be a little more smoother and a lot less tedious and monotonous. I'm sure if I had played as long as it would take to reach the level 200s~, I would've already made 50 alt characters/accounts to experience all of the different classes and give up on it, because the endgame... well...All of the experienced and battle-beaten players who have managed to reached endgame knows...there is no f*cking endgame except one dungeon and world bosses that are camped endlessly. Let's face it, Etup had already moved on from this game as soon as he hit max level. Some of his friends didn't even bother to reach max level before they stopped playing. They aren't coming back unless IMC comes out with some new content, but God only knows when that will be, they won't even listen to the players to fix the issues everyone is complaining about.I only wish IMC took the time to make themselves stand out from all the other F2P games out there in a positive matter, not giving themselves the negative reputation they are giving themselves now. We should have listened to the reviews on the Korean's take on KToS, about how IMC doesn't give two sh*ts about the playerbase and how they are driving their Ragnarok Online successor into the ground. Play at your own risk of frustration and bullsh*t, but to me, it was a waste of time."
I wont tell you this game amazing. Its not a wow killer its not even a MMO where you will have a easy time making friends. what it does offer is a sense of adventure and lack of hand holding. its a mmo you plan every level and make sure the point you spend is the point you always want. The dev team seem to hear us so thats good and it can be alot of fun with random builds and random drops
"I would just like to point out that many of the launch problems that are currently being pointed out in the reviews are general launch window problems for most, if not all hyped MMO launches of all kinds.  Free to Play, Pay to Play, Subscription.  After all, would you spend cash for top of the line server gear if the servers are only going to be under this amount of stress for a Month or two, when the expected lifespan of any MMO is several YEARS?  Aside from a CLEARLY fumbled Founder Launch Period, the main complaint of Pay 2 Win sadly something everyone will make because Dota 2 and TF2 offers so much for free already, because Valve can risk losing a boat load of cash.  Something that reletivily indy crew of IMC just dosn't have, so they need to have some more conventional options in the cash shop that Valve can offer for free.Best I can say is give Tree of Savior some time after the offical Launch and then jump in.  By then, the majiority of complaints currently being seen will be solved, the servers should be stable, and HOPEFULY something has been done about the ♥♥♥♥EN GOLD SELLERS SPAMMING SHOUT CHAT!"
"At first I really enjoyed this game and I honestly thought it had a lot of potential. The game was working great for me up until the other day however, and now my character is stuck in the lodge area. Everytime I try to click on the ""Start Game"" button, it will say ""entering world"", but the lodge screen never changes. I can never actually enter in to the game. I've tried a full reinstall of the game, and I've also contacted support not once, not twice, not three times, but four times. They have done NOTHING to help. Literally nothing. This is by far the worst support team in any MMORPG I have come across. The only response they ever give me is them asking if I am still stuck (which obviously, I still am since that's why I sent in a support ticket in the first place), and then asking me repetitively for information I have already given them four times already. My character has been stuck for days, I've been trying to fix the issues on my own, since support seems to not care much. I would not recommend this game to anyone now, until support gets their act together on actually helping people. It's just a waste of money right now, when you cannot even start the game..Also, according to people on the ToS forum, I'm not the only one who's stuck in the lodge area. There have been several complaints, and yet support isn't doing anything to try and reassure us that the situation is being  looked in to at the very least."
"Ragnarok Online Ver. 2. If you loved RO you will love this. Beautiful art, and music, fast paced action, you're grinding mobs and exp like its 2002 again. pros- complex and interesting job system, dozens of skills to learn and experiment withcons- server issues, many bugs "
"Great lags - even considering a small amount of people nearby.Constant spam of gold sellers - it's simply impossible to walk in town.You can wait in queue for hours and when you end it WITHOUT PRIEST for the 20 time, you doesn't even receive a profit - drop rate is very low.No dynamics, a lot of restrictions  - on the project AAA price.No thanks."
The visual quality and music in the game is quite good - even the gameplay is somewhat fun.The real deal-breaker is the company behind the game. They don't know/want to ban cheaters and infrastructure harming hacks in the game.They literally sold the game in order to access it in the beta for prices you will get 2 AAA-Games.Let's say you bought the game with an pack that's around 50$ - later they charged like 2$ for the same♥♥♥♥♥♥in order to get new players to the game. (exaggeration but somewhat true).The whole marketing and payment-options in the game will let you feel bad for making any decision in ToS.Better hope for some emulator and DONT PLAY THIS GAME ON OFFICIAL SERVERS.
"Just a warning, this game is nothing like RO. Graphically it looks that way and a bunch of reviews saying ITS JUST LIKE RO, but if this game was your standard 3d modeled MMO no one would make that comparison because the gameplay has 0 in common. It's a good game and i have enjoyed it through 4 betas and the Korean release, but don't go into it looking for the next RO, just go into it looking for a Good MMO."
"Really, i mean REALLY, REEEEALLY bad optimised. Just for a matter of fact, i can run Tera smoother than this one, wich should obviously be less demanding.I've searched online and it seems to be like this because of the way the game was developed and it's netcode, so expect no  fix for this.The gameplay is mediocre, but the stuttering makes it an unpleasant experience.Such a shame this game."
"I had high hopes to play this game, however, the experience of not being able to log in gets quite frustrating when you are dropped and then have to wait in queue again for about 5 to 10 min. My experince so far has been poor."
"Didn't hook me and I quit, but I'm gonna give this a positive review because I don't wanna be another grumpy old former RO player here to trash the game because I can't get back the golden nostalgia of my youth. For what this game is it's pretty good, maybe not the most balanced or fleshed out MMO but if you like the style and don't mind a grind I'm sure you could get lost in it. Give it a try."
"Honestly, I haven't played the game very much but the hours I managed to squeeze in were decent. I enjoyed the new mechanics introduced in Tree of Savior. I was relatively excited about Tree of Savior's release and settled on the idea of purchasing early access. Initially I figured the server might not be as stable because I opted to play earlier. It was to be expected that there would be lag or the occasional glitched quest. I believe Tree of Savior is a brilliant idea and overall a good game. I enjoyed the soundtrack and the new controls were an interesting twist from what I was accustomed to when I played RO. Of course, there are some changes I felt were odd, but nonetheless I thought the changes from RO to ToS were innovative. Also, I understand that despite who was behind the development of ToS that I would not be able to duplicate the same feelings I had when I played RO with friends; it is a different experience, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed learning a bit of the lore of the game, soundtrack, and the variety of builds."
"Developers promised make 30% discount, but instead they deleted all regional discounts. Game doesn't cost money which developers want. Game content is poor and consists only of grind, many classes and skills are unplayable, optimization is worst thing which I've ever seen. I don't recommend play in this game.--------"
"Product received for freeI really love this game but i just super hate what IMC doing to the SEA server, first of all keep on maintience, 72hrs, 24hrs, 24hrs. NVM. Raise the price for DLC for sudden. NVM. Alot gold seller, bot, do nothing. NVM. Lag, alot bug, dungeon always not working or DC, Commander. NVM. Delayed the F2P release time.NVM. Been waited so long for my friends joining when F2P release, but now they cant join our server and force to start on new server. and they only know to give EXP Tome and Reset dungeon ticket. brove... well played. The only thing done well is the restrict most of the function and force ppl to buy token."
"Tree of Savior is no doubt beautifully designed. Attacks, animations are very smoothe and accurate. Movement works fine and skill effects are very well done.The gameplay however is VERY REPETETIVE. The game is hack n slash and it seems is all you are doing is clicking a random NPCdoing a quest, going back and taking another one.If you need specific items to collect from certain monsters have fun remembering where they are all located.Very kiddy Bosses and much of the gear (Clothing) doesn't change when equipting it.The game although repetetive can be fun if you party up or play with friends ... for me it was like a 5 or 6/10I always give MY HONEST OPINION. this is mine."
"Ok i think everything has been said both good or bad about this game, on a technical view.  Personaly i LOVE this game and i think it has an amazing potential, tho we paid money to play it one month before it goes F2P. Andddd it's laggy bugged and full of problems that should had been fixed in the last closed Beta really. It's pretty hard to forgive  it feels like they are punishing us for supporting them more than anything else.That being said the game itself is really really FUNNNN it feels like a super nintendo secret of mana game who had a kid with RO.  It's amazing with friends and the skills between the classes mix togheter  like i never seen before, It's a great time.......when it works......but damn me i'm having a blast when it works as it SHOULD be when you paid you know..MONEY.So what i think is if they fix the problems soon and keep on working hard on it  this game will have an amazing future of fun for all of us , and i hope it goes that way. If they don't well.........i guess it's going to die.Now pay 10$ or not?  it depends...its amazingly fun but AS it is now it's really buggy as hell and laggish. So mebbe you'l want to wait until they fix it or it's free to play.     Me tho like i said when it works i'm having a superb time with my friends.  Cheers from Silmeria the blue haired swordgirl, and see you in game maybe!"
"This game is crap. Just bother and look else where for fun. You'll just find frustration and regret.Reasons:- Economy is sealed tight. I say this cause you have to wait 2 weeks for your character to be able to put something in the market. Once you can put an item up for sale in the market, and its been bought, you have to wait 2 days to retrieve the silver that you earned by selling that particular item. With all of that, you lose silver and you can't progress through the game cause you can't access to silver that you have but not really. It'll just sit there in the market for two whole ♥♥♥♥ing days.-Its not a MMO. Sure you can grind on monsters, farm items and be in parties. But its more like a RPG. You have to go through all the bosses and all the stupid stories to progress through and be able to access other areas in the game. You simply just cant travel there.-You die, you drop all your ♥♥♥♥ing gem stones and who ever finds em keeps em. First and for most i'd like to explain that gem stones are very important ingame. They help your character become stronger. Its really hard to find gem stones and very easy to lose them.-To actually ""Trade"" in the game or sell. You have to buy a thing called tokens with real cash. Once you have that you have 30 days to trade with people. All in all i despise the game. I thought it would be fun cause of the system and it looks similar to ragnarok online. Never have I been more wrong."
"Let's get straight to the point:What TOS has to distinguish itself from others RPGs/MMOs (besides the nostalgic feeling)?Gameplay?Story?Sounds?Graphics?Connection quality?(ok, I was trolling on the last one...) :PI really think that If they're not going to implement WOE, IMCGAMES will throw away their only chance to survive through MMOs biggest franchises' competition. If you don't believe me, I'm sorry but you're too naive...IF they implement WOE, I may change my commendation."
"Most of the negative reviews are because they didn't read the store page, if you scroll down a few centimetres you will see info on when the servers will be available, also they asked the COMMUNITY about the founders access and 67% said they wanted one month of exclusive access, the devs just did what the majority of the community wanted, please actually read the store page before you decide to leave a negative review, as for the game itself I played it during the korean beta and even though I didn't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥it was still good fun. This game is the spiritual successor to RO so if you didn't like RO you won't like this.PROS: Amazing artstyle, it's absolutely gorgeous.Good ol' card system from ROCombat is fluid and satisfying with great effects and good sounds.Amazing soundtrack, one of the best I've heard.Loads of variety in enemies and boss encounters are hard and satisfying.This is a game for the hardcore RO fans and it also includes some unforgiving hardcore mechanics such as weapons can break if you fail an upgrade and there aren't many ways to regen HP and SP in combat except for potions. It's not a game for the casual MMO gamer even though it looks that way.CONS:No open world pvpHeavily instanced even though the zones are large, it still makes the game feel disconnected at times.Combat at early levels (especially with archer) is just going around in circles, it get's way better later into the game.Story is MEH even though the setting is great. (Based on lithuanian folklore).FOR THE RO PLAYERS:This games grind is very much like RO, there are 600 levels and reaching level 600 is probably going to take a few hundred hours, if you liked the grind in RO you will like the grind in this game.TL;DR A game for those who liked RO and hardcore korean MMOs, I doubt this game will have a huge playerbase but the playerbase it will have will be very dedicated and probably mostly from RO."
"For making Ragnarok, You guys are sure♥♥♥♥♥♥at knowing how to host games and keep them stable. 1000 person waiting Q's  and rubberbanding like its a self hosted 56k internet 1999 game is about what your going to get.  I crash about 2-3 times a hour when opening, Storage, Vernders, Teleporting, Market manager, or even trying to upgrade gear. Also hope you guys like getting HUGE repair bills from getting farmed by lagged out mobs. Honestly its a good game but as it is right now its unbearable to play because their so greedy they wont invest in better or more server.  So if your waiting to get in the free to play just understand this is just head start population in the game right now and its barly playable. Once the FTP servers go up................Game ♥♥♥♥ing over.  GG you greedy koren ♥♥♥♥s"
"First the bad:Netcode is generic and does cause framerate to stop on server lag. Mildly jarring.Premium service users get more dungeon runs per day, not just more xp. Pretty random. More on the issues with this later.Can sell 1 item a day, but at least you can sell items at all. (Maybe raise to 5, given premium users can sell 10 now.)Fee of 30% for selling is also pretty high, but not out of this world, especially since ToS doesn't seem to emphasize crafting like Blade and Soul did (which adequately gave people 10, premium people 20, sells per day. Given how important crafting was there. ToS might be fine with less.). It is quite random that premium users pay less than a third of the fee, though. Leaves a bad taste with me. Shared storage between characters added as a an afterthought to premium users. Either have it or don't have it, imo.The neutral:Like most recent MMOs, there's an emphasis on completing quests to progress, over the classic grind. Can't say that I like this (I prefer the model proposed by games such as Phantasy Star Online or Universe, making people go, as team or alone, through maps, without respawns. Kinda like if the dungeon system was designed to be the main thing people do in the game. Not the bland thing it is right now.), but it could be worse. Just means you will be re-playing the same story over and over and over with new characters. (On that note, please, PLEASE, make cutscenes skipable)The positive tradeoff is that you can progress pretty fast if you spend your attention on accepting and doing quests. (Outside of dungeons to grind when they come up, because good XP. Here's where I feel giving premium users more runs AND increased XP from killing monsters is just unreasonable.)The good:It's a fun gameFun GameplayEnough depth to keep you interested in experimenting with new classes and builds.Overall, I would recommend this game, because games are about gaming. Not about how much the people in charge have issues with making monetization not a pain. And it could be far worse, so still, give them some credit."
"A cookie-cutter Korean grinder with some bizarre anti-player management decisions and a failure in basic communication. A par for the course.Example (mgmt decisions and communication fail): you can't trade with other players until both you and the other player are lvl 40. At least one of you then has to have a premium token (pay 10 bucks; active for a month). And even then some items that say ""TRADEABLE"" in description cannot be traded to other players--only on Auction House.Did that measure stop multi-acc people or bots? Of course not. The actual players of the game in the meantime get fed up with this incompetent bs and move on.Looks cute though, I suppose :/"
"Once upon a time......is the feeling that keeps me coming back to what is in reality a tedium of restricted grinding.Indeed, the game (which is, in my opinion, a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online) has an interesting, if somewhat simple, fairy-tale-like story and similarly beautiful art direction, injected with an energising, yet somehow appropriate soundtrack. Sadly, those are just about the game's only good aspects.Severe gameplay restrictions, regular FPS and server-side lag issues, a growing Bot and Gold Selling problem - these are only some of the negative points in an otherwise not-too-bad-but-sort-of-shallow Korean grindfesty MMORPG.From a development standpoint, gameplay is solid but superficial and sometimes repetitive. There are more than enough classes (and customization thereof) to play around with, but generally they all fill a similar trinity-like role, with the exception of some world-mechanic requirements (Templar for guild creation, Pardoner for purchasable buffs, that sort of thing). The large variation of skills are bright and colourful, but they scale rather poorly into the later stages of this release of the game.From a publisher's point of view (oh boy), IMC leaves much to be desired. Firstly, some of their restrictions plainly don't make sense. I feel like a lot of them are methods or workarounds to handle the already large amounts of Bots and/or Gold Sellers found on servers. This defeats the purpose, though - you are removing the aforementioned in order to improve player experience, by limiting player experience? Restricted dungeon runs, minimum/maximum market sale values, timed withdrawals on your items, severely hampered alternate character slots and storage systems... As an example, without the game's ""Freemium"" 30 day installment, you are limited to 2 (two) dungeon runs per day. In total. Not per dungeon, no - in total! That's ridiculous. Paying what seems to be around $20 for the Token (which can also be purchased with the in-game currency of silver) let's you run that dungeon once more per day. What's worse is that the drop rates of useful items are so very slim, much more so than any other MMORPG I've played before. Leveling has been painless thus far (I currently have two level 100+ characters) and therefor I am thankful, because the grind is real, ladies and gentlemen. I just haven't hit that part of the game yet, but if the leveling guides/Reddit is to be believed, I better strap myself in for what I can only describe as a boring rotation of skills for hours on end...The Reddit community is decent, the in-game community is non-existent. With a very small cap on maximum guild members (25-35), getting into one isn't the easiest of tasks - creation of guilds harder still.I recommend trying this gorgeous game when it goes Free-to-Play, without spending a cent of your valuable money until you hit at least level 115. Not a moment before should you give IMC a dollar's worth of time - not until they start listening to the community - who have already made more than a few viable suggestions, which, while they may not cure the botting problem, will certainly curb the influx to an extent where the game can be considered playable.RATED SCORE: [ 5/10 ]Once I have a few dozen hours' worth of end-game content, I will re-evaluate my current position. The ball is in IMC's court, after all..."
"The PVE and questing is what you'd expect from a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online. Major issue with people botting, and afk macro killing on spawns tho. If you wanna mindlessly kill cute little forest critters for hours then this game is for you. If you crave something immersive, or complex look elsewhere. Not sure if the game even has PVP yet as wellServers have major issues with lag at the moment as well. With the increased price on 'packs' you may want to find something else to play till the lag+bot issue is fixed."
"Let me get this straightLegend of mana + Ragnarok + Tales of (anything) + GW2 = TREE OF SAVIORPros- Beautiful 2d Design- Overwhelmingly Satisfying Combat- Almost Infinite Class Combination- Free to Play- Classic- Nostalgic- Beautiful Background music- Beautiful Sound Effects- Unique way to play every class- Instance Dungeon like GW2 with 5 man partyCons- Disaster Opening day- Still buggy (but It doesnt stop me from playing lol)- Monsters behavior is the repetitive except bossFor those who rate this game low. I understand you guys, but all of your comments are just selfish. you guys just want to make things easy. - so what if theres no trade? let them play the game and not spoon feed them. Though they need to adapt diablo3 style of trading.- auction house is restricted? of course, this is a free game,  if you want unrestricted auction house go buy a game,- buggy? Lag? of course, this is still on early access, not even officially released!!!! ♥♥♥♥ing idiots!! - Poor AI? if they make a difficult AI at start you think casual players will like it? why not wait until they release a hard content. this is still on Early access!!!!- Need token for VIP privilege? Its hard to maintain a server for God sake!!!!!! its an optional subscription!!!! its not forcing you to buy just to play the game!!!!! ♥♥♥♥!!! I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when I read the comments section. I dont know why gamers these day expect so much content for free,Its like saying that please make me a pizza for free thanks :)"
"Reviewed: lag has been addressed (still existing in busy areas, but game is now playable)-  Gameplay is quite fun specially in groups/dungeons-  Bosses are fun and better than normal from other MMOs-  Interesting classes-  Std MMO questingI will do further tests on lag and broken quest issues before changing my review, but it seems the game is improving.Original review:Un-playable due to lagIt could be a good gameDon´t give them money (like I did :-( ) until they put in place proper server capacity"
"Tree of Savior is one of the most enjoyable MMO's I have ever played. It takes all of the best qualities of its spiritual predecessor Ragnarok Online (tons of unique classes, gorgeous and charming art style, fantastic sound track) and improves upon them greatly while also introducing a vastly improved action based combat system and countless other fun features.I have played most of the big name MMO's out there, and many of the lesser knows as well. My limited time playing ToS so far has been far more enjoyable to me than any other MMO I can recall. The gameplay itself is imenseley satisfying, and the number of incredibly unique and awesome class skills available in this game is mind-boggling. The variety in skills goes way beyond anything I've ever seen in an MMO. There are classes that can telekenetically throw monsters into walls, guys that can stick monsters onto the end of a spear (like a fork) and use them to pummel other monsters, a centurion class that can allow for your party members to join ""formations"" with you (allowing you to take control of them all as a unit), necromancers that use the body parts of defeated monsters to create summons and special attacks, and so much more. It really gives you a lot to strive and look forward to as you progress through the game.Seriously don't listen to the negative reviews complaining about launch week server issues or lack of dev support. It is by no means any worse than the launch week of any other popular MMO, and if you actually look for it you can see that the devs have been doing a wonderful job at keeping the community up to date with their latest developments (GM's have even been responding directly to countless player questions on the announcement section of the forums, as well as announcing progress and fixes in-game via global messages). They even changed their entire launch schedule within a day based on player feedback (ultimately basing their plans around the results of a player poll). Any issues it does have at the moment will without a doubt be a total non-issue in a couple weeks max, so permanently marring the games score based on a few debatably bad days is ridiculous."
"They decided to double the price of everything before taking 50% off. This and other problems I had tell me more about the game company than the game itself. I know every company only really cares about money, but they know that what brings money is a happy costumer, this one seems to destroy its image with every new action and restriction they add to the game.The game itself is good, if it wasnt for all the restrictions add to it so you cant have fun EVEN if you pay for it, also the support sucks, they really dont care if you paid or not, the game is free and they act like they shouldnt provide a good support because of that. Also the items you get are bound to ONE CHARACTER which means, your money is going to the trash when you make a new character (you certainly will, even more on the beggining).TL;DR: WAIT FOR PRIVATE SERVERS SO WE CAN MAKE THE GAME FUN AND FREE FOR REAL AND WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS"
"They have screwed over international countries by now opting out of steam's regional pricing and using exact exchange rates before their ""alleged"" price discount on the 21st.The increases are between 30-280% depending on the country."
"Despite some of the server issues and the trade restrtictions, the core game is great and I would recommend to anyone who is into these kind of games. Most of the issues people bring up will likely get fixed overtime, as this is early access so I'm not sure why people were expecting a flawless experience. The trade restriction is probably the actual worst problem with the game, but its not game breaking, for me at least.I'd say give the game a chance for at least a week, and see how you feel then. Perhaps wait til the game is free to play if you are worried about any of the server issues that are being discussed in other comments. Perhaps I'm being a bit optimistic, but I cannot deny the fun I've been having with the gameplay and theorcrafting builds."
"Though the game definitely has some hiccups in it's first week of release (what game hasn't? *cough*D3*cough*), the less populated servers have none of the lag or connection issues that plague many people and cause their complaints.  Though the game does vastly limit person to person trading on non-premium accounts (aka: f2p players), I've had no issue thus far playing as a non-premium player.  They seem to have balanced the game and its item drops in a way that supports a solo-player's lifestyle.  Even players who cannot trade with others outside of the marketplace are capable of advancing without much issue.Like their initial plans to have a 3 month early access period (which they changed for the better due to player feedback), I expect much to change in the coming weeks to remedy many of these problems.  Should I be wrong and nothing changes with the ""p2w"" aspects of the ""required"" premium membership, the game still has a compelling story, absolutely wonderful and imersive music (SoundTeMP alone make this game a 10/10 for me personally...), and the ability to play solo using only the self-found gear made available.  This game is certainly not your typical mmo, but it is definitely an enjoyable experience."
"Given that I speak from experience ranging from iCBT2 and, as of this time of writing, the early access my views of this game is pretty limited. But here goes:The game is, despite the staggering amount of people throwing down 10 dollary-doos or more, a work in progress. We got in early to both actually play the game and to see if IMC can handle the numbers we're currently throwing at thim. Needless to say, its been...rocky. CommanderLoadFail and his gang have not been kind to us but given past experiences, what MMO has had a flawless launch? Not too many.Still with little than less of a month left to go IMC has been dealing with the rampant issue of RMTs, Bots, and possibly the developer's curse of fixing 1 bug and spawning 99 others in its place. As a player I'm generally patient, I don't entirely understand or pretend to know the inner workings of a company when it comes to managing an MMO, so I put my hopes in the team to know what they're doing and not entitle myself to anything. I don't particularly hold this game up to other standards as, again, experience has shown me that I can't expect Game Y to be like Game X, otherwise why not play Game X.Give this a shot if you have money to spare, if you don't then feel free to wait until Free to Play to give it a dip, Tree of Savior's experience is reminiscent of Ragnarok Online and hitherto vastly different from the MMOs in the current market. Which may in fact be one of the factors that drew so many into this game.Just keep in mind that it's early access, it basically means an open beta so you're bound to see bugs galore and run into trouble every once in a while."
"Excellent game. Most fun I've had in an mmo  since playing playing Vanilla WoW and TSW. This is definitely one of my top favorite games and I've barely even scratched the surface of the game. Sure it has some issues, but what games don't especially in the beginning. Don't let all the negative reviews turn you away from playing this gem. Play it and get ready to lose all desire for social functions lol."
"I don't write reviews often, this probably my second one but I have to, considering how much I enjoy this and plan to throw money at it every so often. I am guessing I am the only person who regrets not getting a better founder's pack?If you're the type of person who simply likes exploring and collecting achievements, this is something I would highly recommend.Pros:-Beatiful Art-Nostelga Factor-Easter eggs hidden through the game-Great Music-Quests dish out appropriate rewards-The Grind is incredibly minor compared to other Korean MMOs (More about this below)Cons:-Lack of Trading-Auction HouseSo aside from the common complaints: bugs, lag, disconnects, gold bots etc, I've rarely ever seen a newly opened MMO not falling victim to these kind of things (there's not a single game I can think of that did have this happen to them at some point). Every single one of them I played had these issues ironed out to an acceptable level. I am looking forward to conditions improving in the future but I bracing myself when the game is open access :P.I am not sure what IMC games is planning but if they're sticking to their initial claim, they're probably using this founder's pack as a way to gauge and optimize the game for those who are willing to support the game financially. As money oriented as that is, don't forget there's no free lunch, someone has to pay for the maintence and development costs. I'd hate to see this game go under like Ragnarok did: http://adultimum.net/rw/extras.php?section=soappservWhile I don't agree with some of IMC's business decisions, they'll likely change aspects of the game overtime. Honestly their response is pretty much expected; can't really expect a new MMO to over compensate the amount of resources required when their player base is unknown.I favor grindy games so I am a bit bias but this is nothing compared to old Ragnarok. I got a character to level 70 in about a week or less and at least 20% of my play time is me falling asleep or watching videos on the side while leaving the game on. The grind can be almost circumvented if you actually take the time to explore the maps and pick-up the hidden quests. Exploring maps and completing quests rewards you with EXP cards which you can beneficial if you plan properly. Anyone complaining about the grind in this game is either:+rediculously high leveled (which is expected anyways, so what the heck?)+tried to get to hit high levels quickly by ""grinding"" and burned out+simply ignored what the game had to offer"
"How is this an international version if there is only US and EU server? The gameplay experience is laggy and is almost unplayable. After a long wait, I am thoroughly disappointed. If you are not in US or EU don't play it."
"This game is pretty fun. The intro was a bit lagged for me. The graphic was good. I like it. Kinda chibi, but good. I played a lot of jrpg games and I'm a huge jrpg/rpg gamer. This game is fun. A bit challenging, but the story is good and the gameplay is smooth.But, I feel this pressure or this feeling in the game when I play that it lacks something. I don't know what. But it lacks something. Maybe cuz it's 2D? No. it's something else. :/ I dunno. One thing I love about this game that is not a pay to win. But a free to play. I would recommend this game for free to play games. But it's not my kind of game. I prefer more action, like FF or Tale Series. More game involvement.Everyone has their own game preferences. This game is well... pretty balance. Not a lot of action but a lot base on character aspect and equipment customization."
"pros: - unique art style - instanced quest boss fights so you don't have to fight with other players to progress - klaipeda has nice musiccons:- extremely repetitive gameplay that involves auto attacking most of the time because you run out of MP so fast due to there being no mp usage balance for skills; skills have very long cooldowns and very high MP costs- skills have a limited number of monsters it actually effects, so if you gather too many monsters your skills won't damage most of them even though they're within range- some skills require items to use, so you're limited by how long your supplies last and how much you can afford rather than leaving whenever your mp gets low- some classes use skills that effect the ground only, so there are times when their attacks are rendered useless because there are a number of flying monsters in various maps, forcing them to auto attack enemies instead or have to run around looking for monsters they can actually kill- the game itself provides no insight as to where you're supposed to allocate your points so it's easy to screw up your build as early as the beginning of the game because you tried to experiment - creature diversity is extremely poor in just about all the maps - you'll see dozens of the same monster in the same spot on many occasions, sometimes on top of each other- too many weapon/skill types vs monster weaknesses to deal with which makes questing a pain; there are many forced boss fights, so you'll more than likely be faced with a boss that is strong against the majority of your attacks or ones you can't hit with your skills because they fly- you have to repair your equipment frequently because you can't do much in the game besides auto attack monsters until they die (attacking multiple enemies at once degrades your equipment faster)- the value of monster drops has been reduced when selling to npc shops since beta, making it even harder to pay for repairs, potions, attributes, and other items- tanking in itself is completely flawed in the sense that you take almost no damage so you can gather large groups of monsters at once, but because of that, your equipment degrades at rates many times that of people who are able to kill monsters much more quickly - bosses are boring at best - most of the time you're autoattacking them for ~5 minutes depending on your class while running in circles to avoid their extremely predictable attacks. - their AI is poor and often they will pause in place for seconds at a time after using an attack.- many of their attacks don't fit their design and are recycled (a tree boss and others randomly shoot bullet hell-type of pellets at you). - many different bosses have the same attacks, even if they're an entirely different creature- hitboxes are very poor, so you'll wonder how you even got hit half of the time, especially during boss fights- quest boss progression is extremely unbalanced - in some cases you can fell a boss in a matter of seconds, but a boss one level higher may take minutes; some higher level bosses are actually weaker than lower level ones- almost no character customization in the game, unless of course you're comfortable spending up to $30 for a permanent hairstyle. temporary ones are around $15. you can unlock some hair colors through gameplay (kill thousands of the same monster to unlock), but they're very dull colors that otherwise should have been added to character creation- everyone has the same lifeless face - there are no facial options to choose from and there are no hair colors to choose from because the colors are locked to the styles- aside from hair style, every class looks the same, so you'll always run into clones of your character (especially in towns)- the only customization after character creation besides the very few unlockable hair colors are hats you can get from monsters that do a poor job of making your character feel unique- player to player trading has been REMOVED...unless you buy premium membership that costs $15 a month that gives the following benefits:* increased movement speed for your character - run around maps faster and hunt for world bosses much easier* reduce the tax from the market from 30% (normal) to 10% (premium)* increases the amount of items you can list on the marketplace simultaneously from 1 to 5* allow training of 2 attributes at once, which has the potential to save hundreds of hours of time as there are hundreds of attributes to buy for all the skills combined- founders get an entire month of head start got damn"
"No game is ever perfect on it's published state, and proper design should always aim towards a better product.Having said that, I think this company either doesn't understand their product or is run by people that are far to focused on the fear of being pirated to even solve basic problems.They had many beta seasons, one month of early acess, and basic functions of their interface still provide wrong information or unclean gibberish to the player.Systems don't work. Assets are poorly described. General lack of refinement.They fear people earning money using their work so much that they are keeping themselves from implementing a sucessful trade system between users. And still they were abused, twice.I am pretty sure that this game has not received a good to go call from the developers or designers and was rushed by their marketing associates. Even if you do need to thrive for perfection, and it never begins that way, this game feels like made by amateurs. And I say that being an amateur myself.The positive side of all this is that I might find more reasons to leave things that slow me down behind while making games, and try to make something better than this.You guys seem to think that a good economy comes from highly controlled interactions.Hope you improve, the fun is there, outside the glass box you made for our own protection."
"As for Early Access review, this game got lots of potential. Devs just need to handle these spammers more vigoriously as its kinda annoying to look at the chatbox and all these spam notice keeps popup on the window. Anyway, the game is rather similar (or better) than Ragnarok (the 1st one) and offers lot of classes to choose and skills to muster depending on your favourite strategies. The game got nice GUI and can be played easily with keyboard, mouse or even controller! (mine is XBOX controller and works totally fine when used to play this game)"
"Quests and Grind. If you're looking to waste your time and day then this is for you. Once you're bored with one class, try different class. Soon or later you will run out of room for your junks. Calling in sick, missing school and sleep all day, play all night.  So basically IF YOU HAVE NO LIFE THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU."
"It's a decent game to turn your brain off to.It seems like your typical grinding F2P MMO but somewhere along the way the rollercoaster derails. The quests will outlevel you or glitch and tou're forced to stay in particular zones grinding out mobs for 10-20 levels, some of which are being ""camped"" by 5 person parties. It's easy to get invited to one of these parties but it gets very boring to grind. I can spend hours grinding with no objective and level up several times, and this is just 30-40... there are hundreds of levels. Not to mention leveling up your job as well which is a 15 level grind that is objectively slower than leveling regularly. Once you reach level 50 you can begin doing dungeons, I haven't actually made it to 50 yet. I made it to 40 just doing quests and grinding out level 30-40. If you have that kind of patience, to each his own but I need some faster gratification!The game really suffers from FPS problems, the fps meter they conveniently place on the screen shows 60-100fps then quickly dips to 6fps when the screen gets busy. This really sucks because you're consistently grinding, and if you're smart you're in a party which makes the screen busier. The game is very demanding apparantly and I don't think it has much to show for it. I really support the idea behind this game but I thought the execution really needs some work. It's hard to be immersed in your character and creating an alt because that's a million more hours grinding which actually feels hindering.  "
"Hello, i played this game, like you can see, a lot. Did CBT and now on OBT.To be honest this is going to be quick and simple  : This game = Grinding. Killing mobs but not like a stupid berserker no like a smart tacticians. Not every map is made for grinding, some are and on those maps spawn is quick on others they aren't for a reason.Second , Grinding, smart grinding. You dont get exp from quest you get card, you are the one to choice WHEN you exp. Are you on a grinding map ? Then no need of those cards. Stay a level or two there. Also to mention : There are gabs of exp need to level. I guess most of people who aren't use to grind a lot will be block on the second gab zone. Lv 85 to 86 Exp needed = 474,895. To get from 86 to 87 you only need 20,757. See ? Know when to use cards, know when to grind. SmartGrinding. This sh!t is korean don't forget.Now that this problem is resolute : LAGS , Yes. Like they said (and this isn't the only time) the last sale day it got really quick. They din't count on that even if they have should. But let them time to cover it up. About the P2W people are talking about : Dont forget this game is F2P. No money no game. Secondo : In my serv (Orcha) for 500K you can buy a token on market = 1 mounth patrone. Easy. Not easy if you play 2hours/day and if so don't play this game. Next to this the first idea was to avoid bots who is a total faill. If you are a bit infomated about what they do with the community you should know they changed there early access for the community. If community ask at long term i'm sure those things will be no problem. They had to start with something , no ? About the dungeons : They are caped because you win Talt , Talt is some sh!t you use for guild (i dint have a guild yet so im not sure about what it does) and next to that those are really good grinding zones. Going in a duo (if you can) is a nice place for some easy lvling (exept the lv90 no good exp if i remember good) Voilà most of topics i saw god a honest long player view. I LOVE this game i dreamd about a game who would include a class system like this. And i hope people will understant the game launched bearly a week ago and IMC is listening. Give them time ! Cheers."
"The good thing about this game is that there's a great sense nostalgia. It's Ragnarok all over again, in many ways: art style, combat system, classes. But that's about it. Everything else sums up to a frustrating experience no matter what you choose to do. I really wish I could play this for months, but I probably won't. And here is why:- Sluggish combat due to general poor optimization and connection issues: you press a key for an action and it takes a whole second for me to see it taking place. It's impossible to kite and mob correctly because what you see in your screen isn't what is really happening on the server side. I often cast my AOE spells on a bunch of monsters but many of them doesn't get hit (same goes for enemies sometimes outside of the AoE getting hit). How can you have fun playing a game so unreliable? I can't even imagine how it feels to play in group, but I'm assuming it's a complete mess.- Terrible performance: even my godly PC rig won't benefit at all from this game. A GTX 980 Ti, SSD and tons of RAM won't be abble to run this game smootly. I get heavy slowdowns in town and even in far away maps the fps is far from constant, even though its a little better. And the load times, my god, they're the longest I've even seen. It's like loading GTA city in every screen change. - The free to play philosophy is dumb. It goes straight against of what RPG essentially means. This is well known in MMO world so I won't dive much into it. But f2p is here in it's classic state. You pay for everything you do in game (in some cases - like equipment and passive skill leveling - you pay a LOT), and of course you won't be abble to keep progression after you reach a certain point, so you'll either buy in game currency with real money or grind your♥♥♥♥♥to death. Even if you don't care for cosmetics, you'll end up spending much, much more then 60  bucks you would pay for a regular game. The worst part of it is that when you pay, it feels like cheating. Before I waste any dollar on this game I'll just let it be.Something went very wrong with the development team at IMC. It's so many core problems I can't even try to figure where they went wrong the most. The game has potential. Even though I can't forgive their nasty fp2 philosophy, the technical problems could, theoretically, be fixed. It's just that it feels like there's a long way to go."
"Im new to the game and I'm beginning to feel why everyone gives a negative review on this game. Lack of support, most of the problems are already said and devs are incapable of fixing things. Too bad a nice game like this falls apart."
"Do you think the game is p2w? This will probably change your minds.This is Darkon's post from the official TOS forums.UPDATED Hair Accessory Enchantment Odds and Pricestl;dr: Cost to enchant a Hair Accessory with the exact 3 stats of your choice? $9,709.20 USD per Hair Accessory. Do you want specifically HP, SP, and Crit Damage all at perfect rolls? $5,126,457.60 USD per Hair Accessory. If you only care about getting AOE Ratio, regardless of any other stat on the item, it is only about $13.68. If you only care about a perfect PATK, and don't mind anything else, it would be $327.60 USD.Edit: Post is for educational purposes only. I can't really take one side or the other anymore because the existence of the item may open pandora's box, or it may end here in its current form. I don't know. Hopefully this helps in your decision about how you feel about Magic Scrolls and the possibility of other RNG benefits IMC may introduce. All RNG formulated with an assumed (until proven otherwise) equal weighting. nizidr helped me realize there are multiple attribute types dealing with elemental damage, and possibly defense, that can stack on the same item. All odds updated from base 1:19 stats to 1:31 (1-17 stats remain the same, 18 Attribute Defense updated to 18-Holy 19-Dark 20-Fire 21-Lightning 22-Earth 23-Ice 24-Poison, 25 Attribute attack split into 25-Holy 26-Dark 27-Fire 28-Lightning 29-Earth 30-Ice 31-Poison) due to previous stats allowing multiple rolls from the same pool of options for those stats only. Appending the 1:19 values at the end for reference.Firstly, as per IMC, 100TP = approx $9.00. From that we can discern that 1 TP = approx 9 cents and 8 TP (cost of Magic Scroll) = approx 72 cents.So.. want to see the odds of getting the perfect 3 stats on your hair accessory using the Magic Scroll that IMC talked about?In KToS there are 19 possible stats. Yes, this could change, but since they have confirmed the scroll coming to IToS we'll just have to use these numbers from KToS for now.19 total stats to choose from and each scroll use has a chance to enchant either 1 stat, 2 stats, or 3 stats. However stat 18 and 19 have 7 sub-rolls each to account for Elemental Attack and Elemental Defense to a specific element. It also appears that while multiple elements can be rolled on to the same piece that no piece displayed thus far has two of the same elemental properties (i.e. a hat may have +Fire Attack, +Ice Attack, +Holy Attack, but not +Fire Attack, +Fire Attack, +Fire Attack) so this is incorporated into the equations at 1:31.To get our wanted 3 stat types we'd take 31*30*29=26970, but, that is for sequential odds, and our stat order doesn't matter (HP,SP,CRIT is the same as CRIT, HP, SP for instance). If we give each of the three stats a number we'll see there are 6 combinations:123132213231312321So we're taking 26970/6 to give us 1:4495, but since we can either roll a single stat, 2 stats, or 3 stats we multiply 4495 by 3 to get the final odds of achieving our ideal 3 stat types on our item at 1:13485.For our costs we will simulate a faux 100% chance by saying if you rolled it that many times you will have been guaranteed the roll you want (even if we know this is not the case and you could re-roll hundreds of millions of times and still not get lucky).So for a 1:13485 chance, just to get your 3 stat types, not including if the stat values are even high, you're looking at approximately $9,709.20 USD For one piece. $29,127.60 USD for all three pieces.Going forward...Most stats have a variance in what their values can be. For instance, PATK has a range between 21 and 45. 45-21=24, so there are a total of 24 different possibilities for the PATK stat to be. In this example, we'll say you don't even care what value the other two stats are and all that matters to you is having those stats plus a perfect PATK roll.1:13485 for the 3 stats you want, but we're going to multiply that by 24 since 1:13485 is just the odds of getting all three stats at any random value. So to get a perf PATK and any value for the 2 other stats you want it is 1:323640.Or, in translation, that roll is worth $233,020.80 USD in the cost of Magic Scrolls.Now, a step further. What if you didn't care about the other stats at all and only want a perfect PATK value? This accounts for any random stats that accompany your wanted perfect stat of PATK, but also accepts the possibility you may not have any other stats on the item at all. To get this we first accept that the odds of getting PATK on a single stat roll are 1:31, but the odds for getting it on a double stat item are twice as good at 1:31/2 because there are now two possible stats on the item either of which that could be our PATK, and 1:31/3 for a triple stat item. PATK has a variance of 24 so we are looking at (1:31*24 + 1:31*24/2 + 1:31*24/3)/3 or (1:744 + 1:372 + 1:248)/3 which gives us 1:455, or $327.60 USD. Sounds more reasonable, possibly scarily so.And if you only want, say, AOE Ratio? Well, that stat has no variance, and is locked at 1, so you are very likely to get it on your item with (1:31*1 + 1:31*1/2 + 1:31*1/3)/3 giving us roughly 1:19 or approximately $13.68 USD. The chances of getting a really good stat like AOE Ratio, that is always by default locked at its perfect value, is very high.However, as per the example I listed in the other thread, let's say I want HP, SP, and Crit Damage, since these three stats have the highest possible variances. What are the odds of rolling perfect stats on all 3 of those on a single piece?HP: 383 to 803, 420 possible valuesSP: 76 to 150, 74 possible valuesCrit Damage: 32 to 66, 34 possible valuesGetting all 3 of those stat types is 1:13485, getting all 3 stat types with perfect HP is 1:5663700, with SP would be 1:997890, with Crit Damage 1:458490.. add those 3 since each is already its own perfect roll, so...1:7,120,080...That's roughly half chance of winning the lottery.You're more than 7 times as likely to be struck by lightning this year at 1:960,000.Neat.The cost of that perfect enchant? $5,126,457.60. Yep, that's over 5 million dollars in case you didn't know IMC, just a heads up lolAnd since we have 3 pieces we need to enchant.. better make sure they are all perfect yeah? I mean it will only cost you $15,379,372.80 USD.(Clarification edit: Please note the above figures are only for HP + SP + Crit Damage, as an example, because these three stats have the highest pool of potential values. This means this is the most difficult set of perfect stats to obtain. If you want, for example, a perfect PATK + a specific perfect Element attack + AOE Ratio, the odds would be 1:579,855 or $417,495.60 USD. Not that either cost is something we can realistically afford but it is important to note that the odds of getting your perfect 3 stat combination, all with perfect rolls, is highly dependent on the number of possible values that each stat can inherently have. The more values it can have the harder, and more expensive, it will be to get the best one.)Do you think its still pay to win? WIll anyone pay thousands of dollars to get a few stat advantages?"
"ONCE YOU CHOOSE YOUR CLASSES THERE IS NO WAY TO GO BACK, YOU ALSO NEED TO PAY REAL MONEY TO RESPEC ANY POINTS! and many of your abilitties become obsolete as you level.Amusing with friends, but there are much better RPGs out there. The real problem is the lack of in game clarity. There are too many good free to play RPGs for this one to be unclear and restrictive. Just play Guild Wars 2. Sorry guys."
"For anyone giving it a negative feedback, just remember: You're focusing only on the bad things. This game is gorgeous, gameplay is super fluid and has a super diverse class system, PROS:- Gorgeous visuals, hand drawn textures and maps- Gameplay is super fluid- Incredible class system with infinite build variations- Brilliant Soundtrack which makes every new area a new adventure- Devs are listening to the community and adressing all of the issues that exist- You need to grind, which might be a Con for some people but this makes your progression even more rewardingCONS:- Needs optimization- Bots and gold sellers are a thing (tho IMC is banning hundreds of accounts every week)- Needs more equipment variation and more MISC items would be good too- The community might not be the friendliest one, and you might be annoyed by non-english speakers- Trade restrictions have been made to make it harder for gold sellers, which is a bummer for people that legitimately play the game, but it's understandableIf you can't decide wether or not you should play this, I'd at least give it a try because the devs (IMC Games) really put lots of efforts into this game and they continue to deliver constant updates and changes based on the feedback from the community.Don't listen to those crybabies saying ""IMC is greedy and just wants money by putting the good things behind a paywall"", this is NOT true. Not true at all and you will realize once you start playing."
I didn't know you couldn't trade with other players in this game without a token. Didn't realize this till I wanted to trade with friends and researched to find that trading was a premium member thing and the auction house (market place) is a joke with long queue times and very restricted listing options. 30% tax for items you want to see is a lot too. Looks like they want to avoid people selling gold by punishing players who don't pay a premium.
"Are you looking for a Ragnarok Online style game with great visuals,  game mechanics, and OST? Look no further than Tree of Savior (ToS)!I may update this review later if I feel like it. Here's a general gist of what you'll be expecting when you play this though.Pros: Amazing art. Great OST just like Ragnarok's. Anime graphics. Tons of classes and combinations. Lots of skills. Bossing and grinding is fun, even after several hours of nonstop grinding.Cons: Like many korean MMOs, there is a heavy RNG influence on drops. There's also a cash shop for cosmetics and VIP service which isn't P2W (luckily). Hopefully the prices will be reasonable in iOBT. Extremely linear quest progression. You literally just go from one area to the next within 5-10 levels of you to complete all of the quests there. Then, you proceed onto the next and almost never go back to the former map unless it has good mobs to grind on.I've played this game 407 hours of this game just from iCBT2 alone. I can't wait to invest many more hours in this game during iOBT exclusive access to test out tons of builds I've come up with. I've even written a few guides on some. If you liked Ragnarok, definitely check this game out. It's not P2W (yet and hopefully never) and it's just a ton of fun to just explore the world of ToS. It can get really grindy at some points though but they mostly fixed that by adding even more quests. :D"
"Beautiful graphics, amazing soundtracks, and simple-yet-fun gameplay... what more to ask? If you want a kind of game where you can just tune out and grind awhile without thinking much, then look no further."

"Edit 2: I guarantee the 51% of people who ""did not find this review helpful"" and played the game are now thinking ""♥♥♥♥, I shouldn't have shelled out $50 for the early access"". Goddam morons. All the top reviews went from ""lol dis is da real ro2 xdd"" to ""okay this game actually sucks, do not recommend"" within a single day of its release, LMAO. Ya'll are idiots for not reading reviews and taking it seriously from people who played this in betas and followed the game for 2+ years. Found this review funny? I found it funnier that you ignored literally hundreds of people warning you about the game and you blew money on it. I guess you'll try to justify the purchase with some garbage like ""but potential"", yeah no. The devs are clearly ♥♥♥♥ing around at this point and ToS will go full Nexon P2W within a year, guaranteed. If they gave up 2+ years of promises in a week, you think they won't drop the facade completely within a few months? Last ♥♥♥♥ing warning, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It FAILS as an MMO, and every aspect of gameplay is total GARBAGE. -- End Edit --Combat is slow, grinding is boring, and storyline is uninspiring. The art is great though. I've been following this game since it's announcement, have actually helped out with translating it to English, and played in the first international closed beta, and I can't say I recommend it. I'm quite disappointed with how it turned out. Fanboys are going to dislike the negative reviews for this game regardless, but I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ They were going to implement a whole bunch of cool stuff like hidden classes and rewards for exploration but we live in the age of the internet; already all the ""secret"" stuff for exploration can easily be found online (based on what was available in the betas), and hidden classes aren't going to be hidden for long. Skill and class system was a cool concept, but then they reverted on their ""no going back"" policy and now you can max whatever classes you want whenever you want, which is frankly dumb. Additionally, this was supposed to promote class diversity, but it turns out there are some classes that are just straight up better than others for X or Y, so if you want to do X, you make class X and spec X, as it's the most optimal build. The numbers are just not balanced enough for class diversity. The skills are just a ♥♥♥♥ing hassle to use, as they all of cooldowns with few exceptions, so most of the time you're running in circles waiting for CDs to come off. SP generation is so AWFUL that you don't want to spam multiple skills, you want to max one and just use that one constantly, or you'll be doing less damage for the same amount of SP, so keep running in circles. If there's a skill that doesn't have a cooldown it's often a MASSIVE SP drain to constantly use, so you're again stuck with auto-attacking (which is SO BORING). I have no idea why they didn't just implement a couple of skills for each class that GIVE SP rather than USE SP, so you can rotate skills properly, or even put SP regen on auto-attacks, so you can build up to using powerful skills. Like most of the problems with ToS, the mundane combat is so easy to fix, but IMC just won't do it.Also the grinding and questing is so bad that you may as well forget making alts unless you really like the low leveled areas and want to bum around in them over and over again. God forbid you mess up your class build and your choices turn out to be subpar end-game, as that's 600 levels of grinding, good luck. (Oh, and there were also a ton of botters/hackers in the game in beta, which is amusing)I'm not even going to comment on the paying aspect of this game, but I will note that the devs claimed they were going to make all their in-game purchases non P2W, though from what I've seen it's definitely running in the opposite direction.The game needs major system reworks. The artwork is pretty and the music is nice, but I seriously cannot recommend this game for any true MMORPG fan. For those RO fans, if you're looking for a sequel, look elsewhere, this plays nothing like RO, it just looks like it because of the art direction. The game has some really good concepts that are refreshing and have clearly had a lot of effort put into it, like the class system and the hand-drawn artwork, but the gameplay itself, the meat of the game, is just so DULL. YES, I am salty. I put in time into this game. I TRANSLATED great swathes of this game when there were <10 translators working on the VOLUNTARY translation project (yup, IMC didn't even hire a professional localization team!). I was hoping for a kMMO that didn't involve dropping $$$$ to win, and I got♥♥♥♥♥♥on. What a surprise.Edit: Oh right, the old ""this is a grindy MMO, you're just bad at the game"" argument. For those people, I'd like to pre-empt you by saying that I am not a stranger to grind-based MMOs, including your rose-tinted RO, old school Maplestory, and a bunch of other kMMOs you've probably never heard of. Grind is fine, the game is boring. If you'd read past the first line you'd realize that the majority of my complaints are not about grinding, but about the actual systems in-game that detract from the product. It's also ironic that people jerk off about the ""WAOW SO MANY CLASS COMBOS"" when in reality they'll probably play a single class past level 50 and stick to it forever, since it takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of time to hit cap."
A year ago Tree of Savior was a game that I liked but refused to recommend to people because of it's buggy and broken state. However a recent update has fixed quite a few issues and while the game is by no means perfect it is definitely playable and a game I can now recommend.Many features in the game are divisive however and it is the type of game where certain things that are working as intended will frustrate certain players while other players will love them so definitely try it out to see which camp you fall in.
Ever since the great rebalancing the game turned into♥♥♥♥♥♥ Majority of the players has quit already. They wanted variety but the balancing just limited people into meta builds. If you are not w3ele3war2 then you are fail as dps for wizard class. They really ruined the game with lottery boxes too. This game is dead and a waste of time. Better to play ragnarok online again than invest on this game.
"Great game that's based on a real place.It's a really awesome feeling to live in Lithuania and see places in-game from here.Especially since Lithuania is small and barely known to a lot of people, I am glad that someone saw the fantasy MMO potential in our Pagan lore, I've always thought it would make a great game story."
"YES, it is grindy and you'll be doing some rather repetative quests...but that's something I truly enjoy about this game. Seeing my character become stronger and whatnot makes it all worth it. The community was pretty awesome as well."
"Not a bad little game by any stretch. I had fun during the closed beta, as well as my friends. The class system is unique and the gameplay enjoyable.I personally touched RO very little towards the end of its life, and was not hugely impressed, this gives a similar feel but HUGELY updated. It is not hard to pick up, but do your self a favor and read up on the class system and get a good idea of the path you want to take as progression is slow, and rerolls are cash shop only."
"Best game for the nostalgic feels of the past Having racked up a few hours playing the game in iCBT2, here are my reasons for you to consider trying it when it comes out.Positives+ Classes for days+ Customization for characters skillsets and attributes (The possibilities for variation are impressive)+ Subsequently has definite replay value+ One of the best OSTs you'll find for an MMO+ Refreshing graphics+ Has support for gamepad functionality+ Story isn't half bad for an MMO+ Bosses for days+ PvP is decent+ Old School Cool/Nostalgia from games like Ragnorok/SoS Negatives- There are bugs that are certainly annoying. (Bosses with the circle attack I'm looking at you! -.-) Hopefully some of them will be fixed by Open Beta- Lack of customization of character looks- Optimization issues- Lack of mobs for everyone at certain places. (Again can easily be fixed with added channels in server)- Don't fully agree with the trading system it has but hey do what you gotta do to keep those bots out I guessThis game is definitely a grindfest but has story elements that keep it interesting whether that is a positive or negative; I'll leave that decision to you.Many things are bound to have changed since iCBT2 but I can confidently say that even with those changes I will be playing this game again when Open Beta hits."
"This game is very good! xD People are complaining so much about the exclusive access, but I really don't care about it...EVERYONE is going to play this damn game! If you don't want to buy it, just wait! O_O Pros:- Great graphics- Too many classes-The same author of Ragnarok <3-Hack 'n Slash!! Cons:-Needs a lot of improvements-Too much grind-Ragnarok's fans like me are waiting for more additions, like new maps, new monsters, WoE, etc;.-Too LinearRating: 7.0/10.0"
"I started playing a few days ago. As someone new I have little to no knowledge about mid/endgame content but I can say I enjoyed my first 20+ hours so far into the game and it turned out to be a lot more in depth and enjoyable than I first expected when I went into the game.So far the only negative thing I noticed in the game is that the free equipment they throw at new players that you can use for 30 days is a bit off the charts. I have been 1 shotting things ever since I started even bosses dont last more than 2 seconds.However even though this is the case I have great expectations for higher lvl gameplay and 1 shotting things feels very satisfying anyway in this game.  Also I love the soundtracks in the game! If your on the fence... just give it a try, its free so at most you lose some time."
"ToS just doesn't capture what I loved so much about Ragnarok Online.What made RO great for me? The openess of the world and the freedom to build gear sets for specific dungeons. And why was that desireable? Because the economy thrived on rare drops found only from specific mobs in specific places. Being able to gear towards +wind elemental damage and +damage to fish and water type monsters would allow you to farm Bib so much faster and efficiently than those who had genereic gear. Collecting drops which had a 1 in 10,000 chance became much more freequent when you had approreate gear - which in turn allowed you to finance more gear sets and higher upgrades on your armor.I didn't catch any of that in ToS. Maybe there is more of that towards the end game but if there is; why do you have to play through so much of the world just to get there? None of the world seemed reusable in ToS. Once you out-leveled a zone, there didn't seem to ever be a reason to go back. The way ToS has designed their class pathing, gear, item drops and player economy just seems more restrictive and more generic than RO. I'd have to even say their '80 different' classes is a bit of an overstatement. So many of the classes you only take for one tier as it serves as nothing more than a stepping stone to get to the higher classes."
"So much potential wasted... I gave this game many and many chances. I even found good guilds, but... everyone just stops playing, and playing alone is bad. Of course i wasted some money, I even became strong (but not so strong as I wanted, cause i was doing things slowly, was not having fun at all, cause the games is too repetitive. I even invited some friends to play... none wanted. This is a farming simulator, and you will probably be doing this alone. PVP is something important for me in games... the pvp here sucks, even the rewards.Play something else!"
"After trying this game a fourth time, I still can't recommend this at all. Tree of Savior, like any Korean MMO, has a LOT of grinding, but little to no purpose for grinding. At the start of my fourth attempt, I made it a point to talk to some of the community, and get some information about things in the later stages of the game. First, I'd asked when the game starts to pick up, which is apparently at level 100. I didn't quite make it there, only managed 74, but I jumped in with a bunch of friends this time that made it way farther than I did, two of them going past level 200 even. To start with, I'll be talking about the early game.The early game is easily one of this game's weakest points. Right off the bat, you have a half-baked story questline shoved down your throat, which doesn't bode well. All the quests in this game are exactly the same, that being the interchangeable ""Kill five two-legged onion people and get thier nipple piercings for me to assemble into a chain to shove into my ear and pull out of the other ear so I can floss my brain."" Plug in whatever scenario you wish, it's probably better than whatever the writers came up with.So, the story and quests are a bust. They aren't the main way to level up, however. Most of your levels will come from killing sixteen quadrillion monsters over and over, which would be fine if they didn't become progressively more tanky, making it take SEVEN hits per enemy in the level 70 area. Crowd control skills would come in handy, if using them didn't eat through your MP like a seven hundred pound man at an all-you-can-eat-buffet. I only managed to get to 74 because I had a Canadian Cleric giving me an OP buff, which we will call, ""The Good"", that causes attacks to just one shot everything.So if you don't have a cleric friend, or unlimited silver to buy The Good from (yes, you can sell buffs to people) the various clerics in the starting town, grinding is also a bust. And did I mention MP potions have a long cooldown? Once you get to 50, though, you can start doing dungeons. The level 50 dungeon will get you to 75 in no time, if it weren't for only being able to enter a dungeon two times a day. Three times if you pay real money. And you absolutely need to do dungeons to get anywhere after 50. But not only are you limited in how many dungeons you can do a day, there's also an item that just CLEARS THE DUNGEON FOR YOU. I wish I was making this up. They're only obtained from monster drops however, so I'll let that one slide.At this point, I threw in the towel and deemed the game unworthy of my time. From there, I talked to my buddies that were still playing the game, and they confirmed for me that the game DOES NOT get better after level 100. You just get higher level dungeons to do. And after your daily runs, you literally just log out until the next day. You could go do some PvP in the meantime, if the system wasn't horrendously unbalanced. There are multiple attacks that can kill players outside PvP, for example. The attack doesn't stop after a duel has ended, and health doesn't go back up to full after a duel. So with one HP left, the onslaught doesn't end and simply kills you. And when you die, you lose EXP and gems you're carrying. And when you lose EXP, you can actually DE-LEVEL. So all the time spent getting that level is wasted. Need I remind you, it can take HOURS to get a level. And those gems? Those also take hours upon hours to improve.PvP isn't just a bust; it's flat out broken. That leaves the PvE situation. Endgame PvE consists of, you guessed it, more dungeons. There's also this tower thing, but that's just a glorified dungeon. The game literally has nothing to keep players playing. The only ones remaining are just there because they've already dumped too much time and money into this game.Sidenotes:You need to pay real money to transfer ingame money to other characters on the same account. Yuck.Basic functions such as trading are behind unreasonable restrictions. Level 40 to unlock trading doesn't sound bad, but as mentioned before, grinding is fundamentally broken.Customization is nonexistant. Expect to look like everyone else.Early game doesn't have any real content; just pointless repetetive quests.Marketplace tax is unreasonable for a new player. Silver is very slow to get early on.Cash shop sells a lot of stuff that gives ingame functionality, just as EXP boosts that wreck everyone that doesn't have them. Can argue pay for convenience, but I label it pay to win as the entire game is inconvenient.TL;DR Beautiful looking game with zero content and originality."
"This and Landmark are why I'm never buying early access to an MMO again.Taking the jump glitch away like you did instead of compensating for it made the game come to a screeching halt and this was even before Pay to win started. It changed the game entirely in a way that made the flow cancerously stagnant, turning a jaunty, bouncy, unique romp through a colorful world into a trudge through a swamp of shattered dreams.You took our Legend of Mana MMO away from us after also taking 15$ from each of us, trading amazing, tangible nuance in combat for yet another F2P number festival that will end up as a waste of your artists' time due to how many people will breeze past everything. You could have gotten us to buy numerous expansions with a game that good.You had everything and you threw it away.You know what you did and you know why your playerbase is shrinking, IMC.You ruined this game. There is no recourse for what you have done.Rest in pieces."
"This is a love-hate relationship with the game, but I generally think its pretty good so far.Pros: Nolstagic Ragnarok FeelingEverything can be obtained by ingame currency.Tons of ways you can play your classes.Huge achievement content awesome for perfectionista like me, and yet still gain decent exp doing them.Cons:Difficult for a beginning free player , as trade have to be used by a token. Fear not, they can be bought with silver. "
"The game is fun, it has huge potential but, currently, it feels like playing an early access beta. Unfinished game, with huge optimization issues. Servers are currently in a very bad shape as well."
"I'm switching my stance on this game because I can honestly say the development thus far has been listening and at least trying to work with the population on many things I've requested so I'm more hopeful and happy.  I'm also still playing so I am enjoying the gameplay but I would caution most to wait for FTP then you can see if you like the game before you start investing :)Changes I'm happy about that make me more able to recommend:  - Next patch they are going to lessen restrictions on team storage for FTP.  This means you'll be able to share gear you find between your own characters even in FTP.- They've enabled a level 40 restriction on shouting which has decreased/eliminated the silver spamming.  This has made the game run better.- They are creating an in game report button for players to report bots you can just right click name and report.  Multiple reports add credence to the ability to effectively ban bots.If you decide to invest in Founders and you want all of the benefits of the Token make sure you buy the founders packs $29.99 and above to unlock Token and all features.  Otherwise expect to have to grind up to 500,000 silver to purchase one off the AH. Positives of this game:- Beautiful graphics, character design, and world design (really the art is great)- Massive world with tons of available quests and side quests (some repeatable)- 80 available classes to create and customizable stat points within those classes give a ton of options- Simple yet fun gameplay.  It is a grindy type game in the spirt of RO etc. so I'd recommend it if you enjoy that.Negatives of this game:- In an effort to stop, minimize gold sellers there is a wait time on receiving funds for items placed on the AH.  They are hoping to diminish the time substantially right now it's 48 hours which is high.  Also there is no 1:1 trading without the Token to diminish abilities of gold sellers who make free accounts.- There are some PTW Faster items in the cash shop and the Token gives you PTW Faster benefits.  I'm not a fan of that so I always caution people befor ethey opt in.- There are still many bugs to sort through and server lagging is an issue."
"Highly recommended, as ToS is a very fun MMORPG that focus more on team playing, solo is fine but boss is extremely difficult for solo (also main quest), which make it very challenging, lvl up to 4XX and tons of map and dungeon to explore, a grindy game but fun :D, not to mention the complex job and skill build"
"Sadly (like REAL sadly) i had to change my review.Partially recommend the GAME. But would hate on IMC.The game is great (like i said earlier) but the company is REALLY GREED AS HELL, and dont seems to care much about their public.So, if you want to enjoy the game (at least a bit more than most players) you should buy cash. You can only sell 1 item per time at AH, and if you sell it you will only receive 70% of the money you have setted as ""price"". As it was not enough, you have to wait 48 hours to receive your 70% part of the money (i wonder that 30% goes for the goddess (only explanation i could find for that pointless tax)).So you want to borrow your friend a sword? It will lose POTENTIAL, just like when you fail to reinforce (what have you friend done with that sw!?!?)Some say that you cant even trade without cash, i cant say a thing about that cus i traded many times successfully.So, until IMC get in mind how a MMORPG works, and how you should treat your costumers, i wont recommend you the game. Its a awesome game indeed but EXTREMELY BAD ADMINISTRATED.Not to mention the bugs/lags.Below is my earlier review, i wish i can let only the below text in the (near) future as my review.--Epic game! Highly recommended.But yet (sadly), we will never have Ragnarok again, its a legend in these days, but Tree of Savior indeed made its way to bring you a nice adventure, specially when playing with your friends.The game is not too challenging as Ragnarok was, some things are pretty easy and linear, but still you have to make your own choices, and play your own style.The RPG System are very nice, inherited a bit from Ragnarok and slightly merged with ""modern mmorpg systems"", so you will have a lot of quests that you wont read any line of them, just completing and getting your reward. But the build system is not dumbed as most MMORPGs are, so you can make cool builds and test your character as much as you want.In conclusion, the only downside i see in the game is the difficulty, could be a lot more challengin, specially the bosses, they are too easy to beat, you dont need to be skilled to beat them, instead, you only need some potions and a character which can take some damage until you drain its HP."
"I really like this game but it does run badly and at the moment there is no business model at all the only way to play premium is to suffer playing as free to play until you can get enough in game silver to buy a premium token from the market so until you can do this you have to cope with the massive restrictions , other than that you could allways buy currency from goldsellers online then buy premium wich is kinda sad as im seeing allot of bots currently in game please tree of savior start selling tp ."
"As an experienced mmorpg player (world of warcraft/ragnarok online/tera online/rift online/etc). I kindna like having a variety of classes to play with, not to mention good quest storyline, exploration and nostalgic feel.After been playing tos for quite sometime. Atlas, I won't recommend this game to my friends for now due to:- Lags- Performance Issues- Bots/Gold Seller- AI needs improve- Too Grinding = Ragnarok online all over again- Most of the high lvl players are quite *hostile* / unfriendly - maybe just me very unlucky keep bumping those people- Not very friendly user in classes, mess up the class build -> forced to replay a new characterI know the game is still in early stage, lots of bug/exploit/bot will occur. But after waiting/looking thru some update patch notes within a month, I have doubt on IMC is fixing the ""right spot"" for the game. I hope in few more months, the game will become more stable then its current status now."
I played in the iCBT and got flashbacks of the days and nights playing Ragnarok Online. The art and music are top notch. The gameplay is superb. I am looking forward to the PvP and Guild Wars (War of Emperium was the thing back then). *I will update this review after I play the full version.*
Nice game but I wished they could optimize this game more. The FPS on this game is terrible for mid tier PCs considering the graphics doesnt look like it needs a high end PC. Nevertheless its a good game.
"Honestly, I really like this game. But recently there's too much bugs and crashes, without even mention the disconnects I've been getting even with my net OK. I spend more time trying to fix my game than play it, and without even say there's some days I simple don't play because I can't even fix those bugs. I am really disappointed, since a really good game like this, with nice design and stories may have all of this."
"This game was bugged, the restrictions a bad joke and the balancing well .... had nothing to do with balance at all. It took some time but it seems IMC finally learned and I am actually impressed how well they improved everything. Half a year ago I would give this game probably about 4/10, now its 8/10.  It feels like Tree of Savior steped up as a worthy successor to Ragnarok. Some balancing is still open but I'd easily say this game is super fun as it is now and if the good changes keep coming I fear about my real life....."
"As far as I've played, the game had some imperfection but still within tolerable range.The most epic thing about this game is its OST and art. The gameplay is average and grind is so hard when you've hit the xp wall.This game takes the cake for classes combination.All and all, if you love classic game and great OST while playing, then this game is definitely for you."
"Despite with all the problem and bugs in the games (understandable since it is new), it still provides a wonderful gaming experience.. Been a die hard fan of RO.. Now i can finally move on.. I believe this game can go far.."
"I would have loved to play this game but it either didnt come with a dsetup.dll or forgot where it put its setup package, either way, I have no way of giving any positive review for what appeared to be a good game"
"This game radiates of poor design and overall lack of content, a complete waste of time. I cannot believe I deleted this game 4 times and reinstalled it, in a desperate attempt to convince myself that if I continued playing it, it would not be as bad, that it would start to feel like RO, and each time I proved myself horribly wrong.The game is a grind fest, each region is just more grinding with different backgrounds and music.I cannot believe that anyone can find this game enjoying at all.I am starting to think that the people who recommend this game are somehow associated with the development company, as I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy...Try for yourselves if you don't believe me, but beware, the time you wasted on this crap you will never get back, and is better spent hanging upside down on a pull-up bar...  peace out.."
"When I started playing this game it was fun.  The zones are beautiful and the music is amazing.  As you level up, you will start to see less and less people in the zones.  The most people you see will be in town, AFK repair and buff stores, and RMT bots shouting for your money.  Not too bad for a free to play...and then I got home from study abroad and installed the game on my serious gaming rig.  Head twitch bug right away due to my gaming rig being an AMD core.  It's super distracting and game breaking, not in that the game crashes, but I can't stand looking at it.  I thought perhaps it was a new bug, so I put the game down for a few months and came back hoping that they patched it up.  Nope.  Looked online for a fix, nope.  All I found out is the bug was there since day one in closed beta and has yet to be fixed.  If you have an intel core you wont see it, so give the game a whirl.  If you have an AMD core, I'm sure you can find something else to play on the Steam Store.Uninstalled the game today.If you want other reasons to not play ToS, you can just look at the other reviews.  It seems that ToS is doing well in Korea and Japan, but they just don't care here."
"Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the genre. I'm a huge sucker for 2-d mmos. Ragnarok, runescape, maplestory, elsword, etc. They give me a sense of control I could never experience in a 3d game.Is the game fun? Eh.It's a game that makes me want to keep playing. There's tons of things you can optimize: hats, stats, gear, gems, skills, class choices, collections, achievements, exploration, crafting, secrets, movement tricks, I could go on and on. It's a game that's simple on the surface but extremely deep. You will spend hours playing this game without being in front of a computer. ProsAt it's core, it's all about the grind. Hate it our love it, you will eventually have to buckle down and do it. I have no problem with this, but others might. Personally, I think the game does a good job of making the grind more enjoyable. A variety of monsters have rare, valuable loot that make you feel like it was all worth it. Crafting requires recipes which are dropped by monsters. Then collecting the items needed to craft that item is like completing a quest and getting a reward. Craft enough to fill out your journal and you can get adventurer points and experience. Gameplay is highly skill based, requiring both knowledge and a bit of finesse. The game is optimized for keyboard controls, so your skillshots can only be aimed in 8 directions. There are still cursor target skills that are better for mouse players, yet still comfortable for keyboard. Also supports gamepads.MehsSome may feel that the game feels too hand-holdy, but that's common for theme park mmos. There's also a very high level cap of 280 that is expected to grow to 600 in the far future. If you're in a rush to hit cap, it will take you at least a month. Some p2w features like putting random stats on hats that would normally all have none. All the hats and the premium membership can be purchased using in-game currency from the marketplace, negating the p2w aspect. Add-ons made by users are also available, improving the quality of life of the game.ConsBugs are present, just like in every other game you're played. Translations are done by volunteers so there are some mistakes in the text that may bother grammar nazis. Bots are somewhat common like every other f2p mmo, but you can block them with an add-on. Some classes are horribly balanced, but that may change as new ones get added. Lag and poor netcode are the biggest offenders. You don't need a good connection to play, but you will be heavily disadvantaged.Personally, I love this game to bits. Though many of its positive features are personal likes, those who aren't fans of the genre will have a hard time enjoying this game."
"Nothing much to say about this game. After hit average level its getting bored. Why? because you will suffer getting the silver. Trading system is sucks, and you need to wait for 48hrs after succesfull transiction at brokers npc and yea people need talts for trading eq/item and dont forget only can be traded between token to token user.. if this system used to prevent gold seller well its failled indeed.. gold seller is everywhere and there always a way for them selling gold.. common dont u see it, they make the other players suffering just to prevents from this gold seller. Furthermore, this mmo is 80-90% solo by questing none stop from all maps, i miss an mmo where i can get friends and played together, grinding at normal maps is kinda useless since the mobs spawn are just too slow, sometime u will really hard to clear the quest since the mobs on the maps are all gone and need to wait like 1-3mins to appear..duh..For the dungeon, there are pretty hard to get party but theres a party finder system that automatch and help u to get in the dungeon but unfortunately they will fail u everytime.. for example, u need to wait for 30min to wait the party match, after gettin inside the dungeon u will see theres no healer, no tank, and people inside like complaining so much at the end they gave up so ur gonna lose 1 entry just like that. sad but this always happen to me. The party matching really need to upgraded, and the dungeon is always full.if this doesnt take any action the game gonna lose alot good player since the leveling kinda bored and pretty tough."
"I basically spent 50$ to wait in the queue and lag for 90% of the time. They had a maintenance period today (04/01) and said that they added servers but nothing changed. The dungeons wont even let me in, the party finder function just kicks me out to the character selection screen AFTER waiting for a party and I even get kicked out with a pre-made group.  The game is pretty linear so when I can't enter a dungeon I can't progress!!It is the first week of the game, but damn.. Can't they estimate how many players are going to start? The mobs spawn in waves, and waiting for a monster in a full map is just not fun. Silver sellers spam the shout function, making the whole server lag, and in the first four days of the game the GM did NOTHING. I'm about at the peak of my patience, the lag coupled with the queue to enter the game makes me just want to ask for a refund."
"Most of the reviews are so inconsiderate. ToS is beautiful but needs a lot improvements on the server side and some changes on it's trading system. The lags and bugs are not forever because we have these so-called ""UPDATES"" jsyk. Be patience until the game reachers it's stable stage before reviewing it. Remember GTA V Steam launch? Let's be fair, guys."
"Tree of savior is worth a look. Great visuals, Good soundtrack, Create a combination of classes and create your own personal build. Allows you to CHOOSE where to invest stat points gained on level up, something most games seem to skip.I seem to have created a dex off-tank that can also dps.Loving it. "
"I would give it a positive recommendation if it was pay to play(monthly pay), but IMCGames decided it was a good idea to release this as a f2p game that features a pay to win premium shop. Prior to the release all we knew was that only cosmetics would be included in that shop. But now you can buy a token that expires after 30 days. It's similiar to gold membership in other f2p titles such as Aion, which is why I don't recommend this game to f2p players. Without the token you are heavily restricted in terms of multiplayer, which MMOs are all about. Furthermore premium users receive 20% MORE EXP for killing stuff which is a huge advantage especially in a game that heavily favours grinding.As for gameplay, you won't receive those nostalgic Ragnarok Online feelings. In terms of graphics, yes maybe, but not in terms of gameplay. This game is holding your hands throughout the game, guiding you through zones with linear quests. And after you've cleared all quests and exceeded its level, you'll never look back to that zone again, which is quite disappointing. To be honest I like the diversity in classes, but its annoying to go through the same quests and zones on every single character again.So as for my conclusion, I can definitely say that if you want an open world MMORPG, you're better off playing the classic Ragnarok Online. As for class and build diversity, I can only recommend Path of Exile instead even though it's more of an online Action RPG than an MMORPG."
"Great game that has a few fps issues (I have a weak build, I fixed fps using -dx11), trading limitations, and dungeon limitations. But, aside from all that it's still fun to play. Don't let all these negative ""p2w"" reviews get to you. The token aspect mostly only opens up more freedom in trading, market, and attribute training speed and does not give extreme unfair ""payed"" for advantages. I've felt the grinding aspect of the game a few times, but it was only because I didn't know how to explore the map well to farm all quests from both Klaipeda and Orsha sides (Those are the two starting points in the game with seperate main quests). The class system is really diverse, but strict at the same time so just make sure not to f**k up your class advancements (do research ahead of time). The game is still very addicting and fun to play with friends. Trading and market needs work and will hopefully get fixed over time. Game is still a great 9/10 and with improvements has the potential to be 10/10."
"Wait for the F2P launch.  Trust me.  Pros:Gorgeous ArtLovely musicInteresting gameplayCons:So.  Many.  BUGS. I can't stay connected for more than an hour, and God forbid I need to change areas.As an avid MMO player, there's a bit of a learning curve.  Very little caracter creation options - you can choose between a handful of hairstyles that are all the same color."
"Pros:Nice Ragnarok Online sequel nostalgy factor.Cons:No player trade unless you pay real money.Spam from goldsellers so bad that it actually lags the servers.Bots running rampant in some areas, making it nearly impossible to level well.Multiple serverissues, impossible to connect, frequent disconnects, very unstable.Bottom line is, unless they will patch and fix a lot of stuff and immediately bring the hammer down on all the botters and spammers, things are gonna go to hell when this game becomes free to play. Some people claim that ""it's still early access"", which is not a valid statement since this game has been available in Korea already. It should be in a playable state but the support and administration is lacking on every corner.Stay far away from this until it gets fixed."
"Setting aside all the Negative and Mixed Reviews on Tree of Savior.you have to look at this game through a Glass Bottle, the game has a foundation and it surely has a directionits stretched out in many ways from what most people can figure out and thats the fun of it, alot of people aredriven by Reviews and Heresays that they forget that an individual has his/her own opinion so before they getto try this game out its already back on the shelf."
Sever has been down for more than ten hours with no proper announcemnt by the admins. Forums got shut down into read-only mode as well.Its really sad to see an interesting game go down so quickly to poor handling.
"After playing this game a while I can confidently say this isn't a good game.It has some issues with being buggy, being swarmed by gold sellers and such, which can be ignored to some extend. But when gold sellers start to lag your gameplay by spamming, I would have imagined it would be fixed in a month. Haven't noticed any difference in attempt to fix it.Class system is certainly interesting. It's also major pain in the butt as it's confusing beyond belief. If you happen to make bad pick with class (which is really easy to do, if you haven't studied all the variances) you might not notice it before going a lot further in game. Also not to mention picking wrong class will mean you have to reroll the character as this game is redundantly harsh with picking your route. Picked wrong stat for your build? Too bad, you are out of luck with this game.As a korean game, it's mindless grindfest. In itself it isn't a problem, but without good dungeon/raids party system and so on it grows old really quick. I have understood this should be spiritual successor to Ragnarok online, but it seems to miss so many things that made RO good. There isn't same sense of adventure, the same quality of mob design, the same unique sound world. It might be because of nostalgia, but having been playing RO quite frequently, I certainly feel more like playing that than this. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. There is better grindfests out there.It's hard to think of good qualities to say when bad sides are so numerous."
"You are the hero of the story, the Revelator. You have come to awaken the power of the goddesses to fight the demons. Sadly, this attempt at being the spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online is just an empty shell. Tree of Saviour has failed to meet expectations, it's just not good enough. There's the dreaded Pay-To-Win system in the form of Tokens. The cities are filled with gold sellers spamming the channels and no one is doing anything about it. PROS1. ArtworkPretty passable.2. Boss FightsNot bad. Demon Mardrox was oddly weaker than the plant monster.3. Goddess StatuesThey allow you to teleport if you worship them. They are basically nicer looking versions of teleportation waypoints.4. The Hype and MarketingThe gondola looked like there was more to come in the game. Too bad it's glitchy and boring in the game. You tricked me good.CONS1. Rampant Gold SellersThere are gold sellers broadcasting their sales all over the game. It's ridiculous. The GMs aren't even doing their job. E.g. www.hoagold.com offers 100,000 Silver for $0.70.2. Repeated ElementsIt's the same creatures every map. The only difference lies in their reskinning. There is usually a large creature, a medium creature with a stick, a tiny ball-shaped creature and a flying one. They are just reskins.3. Combat SystemSucks. You need to charge and wait for a cooldown for all your skills. E.g. Elemental Bolt requires you to charge your attack and fire 3 bolts. After 3 bolts are fired, you have to wait for >10 seconds for it cooldown.4. TokensYou want more experience? Pay cash to get tokens. 9 tokens gets you a tome of exp. Pay To Win.5. Lag/DelayWant to attack a creature? Wait for a delay. Want to move from 1 zone to another? Wait for a delay.Want to let TOS record all your actions on a video but not do anything about it? Wait for a delay.6. GlitchWant to take a ride on the gondola? Glitch.Want to enter the Mining Village? Glitch and teleport all over the map."
"Game should be in Early Access because it's all kinds of broken.  It's still fun to play if you can get past the bugs, glitches & the fact that basic game mechanics like repsecs & character customization are locked behind paywalls.PROS-Custom Classes-Good Graphics-Plays well with ControllersCONS-Bad Default KB/M Controls-Bugs & Glitches-FPS Stutters-Pay Only Customization-Pay Only Respecs-Bad Crafting System-Input Delay-Can't Buyback Items from Shops-Very bad skill upgrade system-Obvious Cash Grabbing-Gold Spammers & Bots-Game Gives Misinformation-Too many Gold Sinks-Very GrindyCONTROLS & GAMEPLAYLet me start by saing the default controls in this game are absolute garbage.  If you plan on playing with a keyboard the awkward setup will have you constantly moving your hands from mouse to keyboard because you can't rebind the keys & the default is something I've never seen a game do on a PC.  Z is attack, WASD are skills & arrow keys are movement but you can't use the UI without the mouse so what the hell is the point of this?  Constantly moving your hands around is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying & uncomfortable. The game has controller support which helps but you still have to switch between the controller & mouse in order to use the UI or hit RB+X constantly to use a very slow moving cursor that constantly resets it's position each time you use it.. You can rebind them, which I only found in the menu just recently & there is a MOUSE mode option that switches everything to standard WASD movement.  Why it isn't the default I will never know.You start the game choosing between 4 basic starter classes.  Swordsman, Archer, Mage & Cleric.  The first advanced class option is available at level 15.  I chose the swordsman since it's my default starting choice for most RPG's.  You have 2 experience bars.  One for your class & the other for your level & each time they fill up you get a point for skills & stats.  Stats are basic STR, DEX, INT, SPI, CON.  They do what you think they do if you're familiar with RPG's.When you make your character you can choose their gender & hair style.  That's it.  No hair colors, no body types, no face types, no hair colors, no skin colors, no clothe colors, etc.  Everything is sold to you in the cash shop because, why not?  Also, if you ♥♥♥♥ up your build be prepared to either start over, deal with it or pay real money for a respec scroll.The biggest complaint I have with the gameplay besides the controls is there is no collision detection between you & enemy NPC's.  So, playing as a melee trying to attack at awkward set angles is even more tedious when enemies keep running through me.  Enemies will sometimes even run away which is even more annoying for a melee like me since you run so god damn slow & they run at least 2x faster than you do so you gotta chase them down every single time.UPGRADING SKILLSThis has to be put in it's own section because it's just plain stupid.  So, you learned a new skill by spending a skill point.  You can upgrade that skill you just learned by spending silver at an NPC.  Simple right?  Well it would be if you didn't have to wait a mandatory cooldown after spending that silver to learn it.  This can range from 5 minutes to over an hour depending on the skill & the level of the attribute upgrade.  Absolutely no point in making people wait for upgrades & yet this game does it.  It wouldn't be a huge issue except you can only learn one skill upgrade at a time.  So, yea.  Imagine having enough money to upgrade a skill from rank 1 to rank 10.  Now imagine waiting 5-10 minutes for every upgrade to actually happen.  That's over 2 hours of waiting.  And then you have another skill you want to upgrade after that.  Another 2 hours.  It's stupid as all hell.GRAPHICSThe game is pretty & the artistic style is very well done.  Animations are nice & fluid while the art style is cel shaded 3D mixed with hand drawn 2D sprites.  It all goes together very well.  Another game I've seen that used an art style like this was Wakfu & that game also looks amazing.  It would be much more enjoyable if the FPS didn't constantly stutter, though.CRAFTINGSo I got far enough into the game to check out the crafting system & it's kind of an odd one.  So you can buy recipes or find them in the wild or off of quests.  You need materials to craft the item obviously & you can theoretically craft anything you have a recipe for, HOWEVER, one of the ingredients IS the recipe itself.  So, once you craft said recipe it's gone.  You need another recipe to craft it again.  That's just stupid, especially when the recipe is listed in the journal once you pick it up.  It's the equivilant of having a cookbook to show you how to cook & throwing the book into the pot with all the ingredients.  It makes no sense at all other than to give you more reason to grind to earn another cookbook every time you want to cook something even though you have another perfectly good cookbook that can't be used for some reason.MISINFORMATION IN THE GAMEYea, I'm fine with figuring out stuff on my own but like I said, some things aren't explained or just have straight up misinformation on them. Like ""Right Click to add to the Adventure Journal"" or ""Recipe's are learned once you use them"". Flat out misinformation. You can't learn recipes at all (not in the traditional sense anyways & everything you pick up is added to the journal right away. I had to figure that out on my own because the game flat out lies to you & not in a Dark Souls kind of way, either. Then there's the 2h swords, they have a description that says, ""Level 15 Swordsman Required"".  What that actually means is, ""2H Sword Skill Required.""  You can learn the skill but you need a specific advanced class to learn it.  Basically vendors lieing about their products to get you to buy them only to find out you can't use it.OVERALLNegatives aside I am still enjoying the game because I like the class system but I can't recommend it because it's just so broken & it's using the usual BS F2P Monetization that I oh so love to hate.  FPS constantly stutters & can dip below 10FPS.  Constant lag & rubber banding.  I even had a glitch that forced me to restart the game to fix it involving an elevator in the first dungeon.  Another situation where there was a gold spammer spamming so much my FPS dropped to about 5 & I couldn't move.  If you try this game just be prepared for a lot of lag & constant BS from the usuall F2P garbage.Now don't get me wrong, I want to like this game.  I like the graphics, custom classes & once you get used to the controls (or figure out there's a mouse option) they aren't that bad.  It's everything else that makes me think this game is garbage.  The obvious cash grabbing, the waste of time skill upgrade system, the stupid crafting system that requires multiple recipes even though you have the recipe in a journal, etc.  It's just bad man.  Bad game design in general meant to pad the experience.  If they ever get rid of all the BS, fix performance issues & glitches I'll gladly swap my recommendation."
"Did you play Ragnarok Online when you were younger? Well this game is a throwback to the nostalgic RO, the art style is amazing! The controls are abit annoying at first with the limited amount of keybind options, but when you get the hang of it the game is really fun, aaaannnnd with so many classes and the crazy level cap of 300 lol~ I highly recommend it to any RO fan or ...hmm Korean MMO fan."
"This game is super fun! More fun than I thought it would be. My husband played when it first came out and I was thinking about trying it too, but was disappointed to hear that he bored of it pretty quickly. Fast forward to last week when I started playing what is apparently the ""new and improved"" version of the game. I already knew I was going to love the artwork from what I'd seen on Steam. I happened to start during a new player event (highly recommend going this route if you can start during one). My favorite things to do are: get map exploration to 100% for ALL the zones! and do quests or dungeons. Quests are always interesting because there is a variety of things you need to accomplish. It isn't always ""kill this mob"" or ""collect this drop"". And frequently they involve some sort of instanced mini-boss appearing, which I enjoy obliterating the crap out of with my new player event time-limited OP AF staff.For reference, my MMO of choice has mostly been Maplestory, and it's been hard to get into any others I've played. So... take this review for what it's worth. ;)"
"Game is still young and IMC is still experimenting.If you love Hard grinding games where RNG factors this game is one of it, from great art to OST. Character Classes, Skill diversity, boss design and Cosmetic's(but it's not enough). only thing that's ruining the game is the connectivity Issues due to too much bot overloading some Servers, trade restrictions(but IMC is fixing that one) and poor optimization even with a good computer you're FPS will drop hard if you're at towns and when world bossing.overall its a good game, once you got into it you'll just end up playing more."
"The game has very little to offer beyond longevity. There's no sense of community in the game. There's no zone-wide chat to cooperate with others, there's only global chat (which takes a consumable item to use) or party/guild chat.As an MMO, it's a failure. The game doesn't rely on healers or tanks for dungeons and missions. Bosses simply get zerged while they mindlessly walk towards their aggro target and use AoE attacks. Healers sometimes can save you when potions are on cooldown, but generally they're unnecessary. Class balance is AWFUL and the AI is really bad, so if you play a pet class be ready for frustration.Leveling goes up to 280 or so with stat points, skill points, and class progression that you cannot undo (some can be undone with microtransactions, but others cannot). Core gameplay consists of:Questing - standard uninteresting MMO fair with minimal rewards.Exploring - small reward for discovering 100% of a zone's map. Very difficult with the base UI, but mods make it less confusing.Combat - hit a few cooldown with 15-60 second cooldowns. Then procede to auto attack a bunch, even if you're a mage or priest. Then use a mana and/or health potion to continue. There's no challenge to be found at all.Dungeons/Missions - kill a bunch of trash and then fight several bosses. This gives MUCH more Exp for the time invested than anything else you can do, yet it has a daily limit of 2/3 for each. Basically this is your ""daily quest.""The game is full of bots spamming their websites in town or in the global channel. Completing quests and grinding Exp can involve more waiting than killing between sitting at a bonfire for SP if you choose to and waiting for monsters to very slowly respawn. There's also the option to camp world bosses that spawn every ~4 hours, what fun!The UI is clunky, and while there are 3 control modes (gamepad, keyboard, mouse), none works 100% correctly. The servers have awful performance despite a very small playerbase, and the game itself cannot maintain even 10fps on a GTX 970. I've routinely seen my FPS go above 120 and below 10 in a very short time period.If you want to try the game and not pay anything, feel free I don't think that's a bad idea. Focus on doing all quests (you need to talk to NPCs, they don't have an exclamation over their head) and exploring all zones. Don't use Exp cards until you are desperate to level up.If you wanted to spend money on this game, please don't. It's in a horrible state and probably won't improve anytime soon."
"I used to be a huge RO player... and Tree of savior, despite its current issues, is the drug of all drugs on nostalgia, Beautiful BGM OST too... 3rd wave.. cant stop listening to it. I hope the game improves because im having a ton of fun, it may get grindy, but thats to be expected, (You ever played RO? lol...talk about grind..) I enjoy the class system, and the game has a lot to offer. I dont get all this super negative posts about it, I really dont. I have yet to experience the sourness that many have spilled over this game... "
"This game has received a lot of bad comments, at the time probably deserved. But right now in 2017, is game is truly not the same as before. There's patchs and new contents every weeks, a lot of events, a lot more contents, big features incoming. If you want to know what's the shape of the game, then do not read the old comments and read the new one, because you might not like the 2015 tree of savior, but I can assure you that the 2017 tree of savior is not the same at all."
"Played this game last year, wanted to hop on back today. After installing the game and hitting the ""play"" button. Launcher would appear but nothing much happens and then launcher dissappears. Game does not load, launcher shows "" 0% arranging files 0%"" and then dissappears. Tried so many fixes for the pass 3-4 hours, nothing works. WTH is going on, the game wont even launch? every other game on and off steam has no issues. How can we as players enjoy this game, if its always freaking buggy? Such a terrible experience."
"""Tree of Savior"" is a very interesting and enjoyable game not only its ""F2P"" it has alot of benifits that make this Game enjoyable. And this are the Classes and its Advance Path we players choose and they are ALOT!, The Main Story quest, Dungeon&Raid and awesome Events. Lets not forgot the BGM of Every Map no wonder alot of Guild wars are Fighting for its Territory, PVP and its ART for Scenery and NPC are really detail."
"Product received for freeWell to start off I will say I went into this game really wanting to enjoy it, dispite the fact that the servers are horrid, flooded with bots, and to top it all off are paired a poorly optimized client... but to put it bluntly there is just too much wrong with this game to even consider playing it at this point, and this is from a regular beta tester. Rtm bots currently outnumber the human players about 3 to 1, and around a forth of the human players I see are sitting out of main traffic macroing. It is worth adding that at this time it has been almost a week since they restricted new players, and we are still dealing with a flood of bots which brings me to my next issue, the management.Currently I have made 3 tickets with support and the replys have been copy paste replys, literally word for word the reply given to every player for every issue.""Hello Savior,Thank you for contacting us. Its possible that you are experiencing connection issue while you are in the game. Please try to relaunch the game from Steam, and make sure that you have a stable connection while playing the game to avoid this kinds of issue.If you have any other concerns, please do contact us again.Regards,Tree of Savior Support Team""I will post the short version of the tickets I got this reply to at the end of this review for those interested.At first I defended the managements difficulty dealing with the rtm's as all free to play games tend to have this issue, but after the new account creation restrictions were placed it became clear they just dont do anything about the issue. And we are just getting started more then half the skills in the game are buggy1. Getting silenced mid cast freezes you mid animation for several seconds.2. knockup/knockback causes mobs to postion lag and become immune to melee attacks, or float above melee range.3. any monster cast ability will cast even if the monster is killed, knocked up/back, or if the player moves out of range.4. many buffs require you to be standing INSIDE the caster to share.5. monsters spawn a million miles in the air.6. players fall through the floor on every other spawn skill in the right situations.7. trade limits are not clearly defined and/or bugged, certain methods of trading will render items untradeable rather then lowering the trade limit by 1.8. gear sometimes brakes instantly on death when repaired above max durability(class repair skill bonus)9. daily limited maps sometimes close before you load in comsuming a daily count.10. respawn option sometimes only gives the choice to pay to revive Unconfirmed if this is intended or not.11. entering maps sometimes causes players to enter a empty map giving the player cap movement speed and preventing map changing.12. being knocked down can render the character frozen facing the screen with map wide basic attack range and no ability to use skills or jump.13. defensive skills cause players to take 10x more damage when cast on you by a lower level player.14. bosses sometimes decide to change direction mid direction locking skill 15. bosses ignore their own skill cooldowns. This one is a lot of fun, theres a level 110 boss that actually turns the entire floor into lava FOREVER dealing 1.4k damage per tick, and another boss that will spam skills with no cooldown is the level 120 boss but he prefers to put you into a endless state of knockdown this is not confirmed as a bug, but when you can be mid knockdown animation for 5 minutes flat theres prolly something wrong... I mean when the level 220+ bosses are weaker then these 2...A quick run through on the tickets I got that same copy paste reply on.macro report 1 - a level 213 dude set up a turret macro ontop of my partys grinding spot screen capped him for like 10 mins looping a simple spawn macro like recasting abilitys on the same cell at a exact ms delay. reply - No action taken I was just expirencing connection issues?Macro report 2 - level 208 guy simple right and left macro again recorded him walking into walls after mob knockdowns alters his position for like 10 mins while stoping to loop attacks on exact ms delays.reply - No action taken again I was just lagging again...Lost a gem and raid do to server issues - enter a low level raid get knocked down by a boss fly into the abyss, and when the black screen clears my character is stuck facing the screen only able to use normal auto attacks which hit the entire map up to the max targets per slash. obviously die when I am unable to cast any ability or move, and rather then getting the normal death menu I am only given the option to pay to revive. I knew it was a long shot but I poped a screenshot and submited a detailed ticket hoping to get back the rare gem I dropped.reply - No action taken, But this time human hands typed one extra line and here it is in all its glory""use a Soul Crystals when you dies in the field to able to retrieve the dropped items immediately."" which leaves me to assume the missing revive option was intended... Please insert 25 cents to continue playing a broken game. Sometimes you get to respawn other times you are forced to pay I guess.I will updating this review again in some time with the hope that the game improves, there is alot of potential (which can be said for pretty much every other game out there...) but at this state I would say keep your distance and hope for the best."
"Didn't play long enough, but got a good feel from the short time I did. I regret throwing any money at it. It is has amazing potential, but too many cons that are covered by numerous reviews already to repeat.If you're looking for some Ragnarok Nostalgia, it will give you a little. It is probably better to go back to RO than give this buggy game a go.Hopefully the developers listen to the community at large and fix the issues, or sell it to another company that will do right by it."
"Sorry was a great game and all I love it but after 300 hours of beta then release comes and they lower spwan rate by more then 50%. They also fired the only community manager so their is nothing from anyone at IMC now, and the biggest thing now is they don't or will not give a any content updates except once every 6-12 months dead game is dead, so poorly put together that the private servers dropped it cause it was unsaveble."
"TREE: Repercussions of LagMargot waited. The graphics above her glitched and flickered out of the air. There were demons in the channel. She didn't see them, but had expected them, now for days. Her warnings to Knite Cornder Ussa were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.Margot was a hoplite for seven days. When she wasnt playing she watched the korean vids and she said to dad ""I want to be in the dungeons, daddy.""Dad said ""NO! YOU WILL BE KILL BY DEMONS!""There was a time when she believed him. Then as it went F2P she stopped. But now in the royal mausoleum of the king she knew there were demons.""This is Ussa,"" the chat crackered. ""You must fight the demons!""So Margot gotted her grand spontoon and stabbed open the wall.""SHE GOING TO KILL US,"" said the demons!""I will axe at her,"" said the Bearkaras and he did the spinny attack. Margot stabbed at him and tried to pierce him up. But then the fps fell and they were lagged and not able to kill.""No! I must kill the demons,"" she shouted!The chat spammed ""Cheap Silver Fast Delivery Cover 10% commission for market place.""And then, the server went to a 6 hour maintenance.Kudos to Peter Chimaera for the original fanfic. Aww geez... Has is really been 14 years since he wrote that one? No wonder if this seems like original trash then.Anyway... I love the game, but it's definitely not for everyone right now.  "
"Product received for freeAfter just a few hours of playing, I can already see this game becoming one of my favourites. Beautiful artstyle with an enjoyable gameplay that will provide tons of fun for hours. And best of all, it is free."
Satisfying to sprint around as a swordsman and thwack those crystals and keep sprinting. It's nice that jumping is useful and functional part of combat to evade attacks and get around. Also nice when you level up and hit everything on screen with the level-up explosion. It's super nice to have a game that has extensive class-advancement again. It's really good like this.
"If you liked ragnarok, you'll like this.  A lot of interesting anti-inflation ideas are in this game, some of which are a complete drag but there is a balance to it; Long term effect is yet to be seen, of course.  Interesting combat with a unique classing system makes this spiritual successor an improvment over the forefather.  Giving this a 8/10, just remember to bring friends for optimal gaming experience.  It is an MMO, after all."
"The game if full of bugs and connection problems and the administration seems to not care at all. When a game dont work, you should make a maintance to make it work, its simple. The game was already full of problems and instead of making it work properly, they simple made it wrost by opening to the free players. Paid for 4 DLCs of this game and now I simply cant connect on any of my 4 chars. Very nice. Also, lets not forget the problems with the trade system.1. You cant trade silver even between your owns chars.2. You cant trade high level itens, making them useless when you drop items that are not for your class.3. You have to wait 2 days to get your money when you sell something on the market. 4. When you guy materials/recipes from other players, it becomes untradable, which means you cant even pass that items to your other chars. 5. Now you have to wait almost a week to buy something from the Market when you're a new player. And the list goes on and on. The game is just asking to die with all that problems."
"+beautiful landscape & chars+cinematic boss intro+good controller support-lack of skills-uneven spawn rate, rate too low when you need quest item from monsters but the rate too high at the place you need to gather items and they'll always interrupt the gathering process-some bugs need you to restart the game(e.g you suddenly at the sky when trying to jump on the moving bridge)"
"Product received for freeIt's a really fun and enjoyable game overall, brought a unknown and really interesting recipe for MMO's. But went open in a terrible and unprepared state.I'd rather pay 10~20$ a month than play free.I also would love to recommend playing it, but you have to be patience as you'll be facing lots of game breaking moments. "
"I read the game is a Korean Grinder, and I guess that is true. I like the 2d art, the music (which I rarely like in games),and the leveling system. The system works where you do quest and get cards to spend when you choose.  So, you don't feel like you missed out if you out out level an area. Each time you gain a class rank, you get 2 new classes to choose from.  It makes for a wide character selection.It's FTP and I don't feel like I am missing out on anything by being cheap. Totally worth a try. Downside is, to combat real money trading the market is locked to new accounts for a few weeks. Kind of strict but understandable."
"Mannn I just hit over 1000 hours in this game and I guess I like it? But like, ironically because me and my friends who play the game love how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥how it is. But still, I did drop 1000 hours into it so...worth that? If you're looking for the f2p mmo experience you'll get your time's worth for sure. Don't play to lone wolf it. Join a guild, make friends, join some ToS communities and you'll find the fun here. It's not a lonewolf game."
"game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, play it for exactly 30 minutes and quit, not even playing with friends can save you from this cancer. theres bugs everywhere and massive server lag all the time. better off not playing anything and just watching glue dry."
"Unable to patch game, because ToS download servers are that bad. I have no problems at all downloading games from steam, but 20 attempts to download ToS and still failing. I give up, they should not replace a good network protocol with a bad one."
"There's no need to go into gameplay when reviewing this game. Invisible walls in cable cars, party getting stuck in quest scenes, P2p only storage between chars, switching mouse->keyboard for certain quests. They seem tolerable at first, but after doing a couple of quests it just gets harder n harder to play. FIX THE DAMN BUGS!"
"I have done fixing like, update lost patches many times after this game crashed and ultimately leading to re-install.If after this I've installed and still I can't run the game after running the launcher, you guys are totally make me♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Cause' I've sacrificed my 1 week holiday grinding to level 103 and this is what I get??"
"Yes, servers are currently in a rather poor state. But the core is fun and unique.IMC listens to complaints and make !daily! HUGE positive changes, so we have that.Also most negative scores have 50-1k hours played and check their play time last week.. the controversy."
"I've been playing the game quite a lot, and even though the producers take some actions with their game that the players really don't like some times, the game is GOOD.There's still a long way to go in terms of polishing the game, and the community needs to be patient."
i give up this game..too many limitation and even with token they're still ridiculous limitation. With the new update even transfer silver between character in account needs token. basicly all that should be free system in every mmorpg required token(cash) in TOS.
" Game f2p but not to do actual things in game?  ""gotta pay to trade between people. gotta pay to put more than 1 item in the auction housegotta pay to train more than 1 skill at the same timegotta pay to reset skills gotta pay to use advanced emotesgotta pay to customize your characterstechno music all over the place ( but in the log in screen ) game looks artistic tho. "" "
"""We had such potential... such promise. But we squandered our gifts, our intelligence. Our blind pursuit of technology only sped us quicker to our doom. Our world is ending. But life... must go on.""Pretty much this game and its dev team."
"Very amazing game, I adore the cutesy graphics that this game has, along with the ""cute"" atmosphe this game gives the story that this game tells is actually really dark. Normally when I play MMO's I dont focus on the story and just get right into grinding, but this game made me take my time and learn the different charecters that are in the story. This game is really good and everyone who enjoys MMO's should def give this game a try!!:)"
"This will be a short summary of the game and its main Pros and Cons that new players would be interested in knowing.Pros:Great gameplayInteresting skills treeGreat stat system, choose what you want to advance in. want to be a physical wizard? put stats into strength! .. ectNice art styleRequires Grinding but it feels rewarding.real time battle system (attack and actually move out the way of attacks to not get hit). Massive level cap with a much higher cap to come. Cons:Grinding (if it is not your thing)Lag, even on a GTX 780 TI Gaming Overclocked and a i7 I get major lag at times, sometimes completely halting movement and button inputs. 72 hours wait until you can trade or use the market (attempt to stop gold sellers...Still gold sellers everywhere)POTENTIAL! an element to items, want to trade? lose some potential on the item, meaning you cant upgrade it as much.No free trading between characters, to trade for free between characters you will lose 2 potential as you have to trade with a friend and back (really irritating, stops you being able to fully upgrade the item).The game is fun and interesting but is held back by the games attempt to keep gold sellers away and to keep the economy of griding alive. Id recommend playing it, its free and it is in essence a brilliant MMO with loads of content."
"Product received for freeTree of Savior offers a lot of the things that got me into MMOs years ago. Highly customizable characters, a huge explorable world, dozens of enemy types that are not just blank models in different colors that throw attacks at you in set intervals. It invokes a certain nostalgia with it's 2D grindiness and surely shares a strong similarity in terms of art design with the game Ragnarok online, but it is more than that - it has a very unique and interesting class system that allows you to create characters to fit your playstyle and needs, the battle is incredibly interactive and fun and for those who like them - there are whole areas dedicated to puzzle like events.Character movement can be clunky sometimes and there are some weird issues with some of the control options, the game surely has performance issues it shouldn't have and the streets are full of gold spammers. Weirdly enough this is a free to play game that makes it incredibly hard for you to spend money, which is good 'cause the pay-2-win argument is something you can still bring up, but it surely isn't as relevant as in a lot of other free MMO games.Despite it's flaws this game is incredible and unique, it's probably not for everyone, but you should check whether it is for you."
Despite many (yes) bugs that need fixing. I am still  honestly enjoying the game.I'd spend my extra hours playing and I think it's really worth it.Although I really wish they would make a FLY because it's really tiringto run from map to map that has no statue D:
"its worth trying the game  can make  a lot fun but it feels after lvl 60 (im lvl109)  i always have the feel developers want only the time and money of the players becouse :- paying money for skill reset .... its so easy to make mistakes with your build but you cant reset attributes or skills .You cant even try out skills for planning future builts with a skill/class system , are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me ?- game flood you with crafting items and you dont know you will need them in future , stash is small and more stash space cost money (share stash with other characters cost money)- no ""fair "" grinding(exp farm) places , the small anmout of mobs and the low mob spawn rate and the nearly endless   quests suck the life force out of you the only good farming place was Teneth Garden until lvl 43 (nice place to party with other players , also the only place where i dont felt lonely in this game)dungeons feels  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for lvling (entering dungeons only twice per day) ,lvl 100 mercenary missions gives nice exp but also you can entering only twice a dayi see raging people everyday becouse there is no exp farm place ór not enough quests for lvl 170 - lvl 200 - Main Fun Factor is building his Character but with the problems above i described (+ stat reset would be nice ) you lose the fun and motivation for plyaing this game(+) pro for playing - nice music- interesting graphic style- interesting class system (some classes should have more class attributes at circle 2&3 / some classes should be reworked/balanced)- developers bring out patches every week , making the game more stable/fixing bugs/bann bottersthumb goes up if they add skill reset without paying 8 $"
"Product received for free********IMC, we're waiting news about servers and channels. Please, don't leave the support game. ToS need many attentions.********In other questions, ToS brought us hope. Finally, we have an old school mmorpg to play on steam.*-*_ Grindings_ Builds stats and skills_ Exploration_ Farm Itens and Equipments_ High Level Cap_ A lot of classes to choose and many possibilities to create an unique character."
"Fun game with many classes and customisations, a lot of grinding but the battle system is kinda funny so it keeps you motivated.The game has a lot of problems but for my pov it`s not that bad. I am a solo player so I don`t care about the trading restrictions and I am playing on the EU server so no laggs either^^Don`t listen to all the haters, I get their points but all in all it`s a funny game and I would totally recommend it."
"It will be one of my MOST  favourite of all time... no doubtim lvl 255 necromancer now at the moment of this reviewBut, lets get to the point. Shall weMost review cover pro and con already so i'll just share my experience instead.1st ,The balance is LOL ,but that's what i like. Noting is fair, you step in wrong direction .. just pay the price, and change how you step.its kinda about plan your build and study carefully , most of the guide out there is not really from experience people at allso many thing done wrong cause the bad guide .. but they give you an good overview anyway. so study... :3theorycraft is limitless here. so many combination, maybe your'll find your right class that have good role.. who know..BUT PVP built rekt PVE build too , dont forget ( because of sustain and burst) ...so dont take PVP as everything.2nd, The staff seems pretty inexperience but they at least try to care .. so im OK with that. ive seen a very slow improvement over time, and that's good enough for me.3rd, Grinding is super boring  but the new skill i will earn keep me moving over period of time... it's worth it for me . talking to people is while grinding that is nice too4th, addon is godsend... like Better quest and minimap helper. install them for better experience. Its a must if you cant take old school method of unfairness leveling... xD5th, this is pretty irevlant .. I play WOW and GW2 before, i like it and play it for looong time. but to be honest this game has tons more fun for class and leveling.. but worse part is the content for endgame is pretty hollow now.. hope it improve later (this is expected for new game though)lastly, about the negative... most of the complaint is correct ,just dont get them wrong , the game is full of good people to be friend  with tons of fun moment. Solid concept .. for example my summoner built is the best one i've seen in all MMO experience for me. very strong but have tons of weakness(which make class seem ok.. not to powerful). summons extremely stupid but i like how they're like this .LOLi'd give it 9/10 for overall. the atmosphere ..BGM... class. this is what i always wanted in MMO "
"DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON OR PLAY THIS GAME IT IS NOT WORTH ITThe developers does not listen to the community at all... literally.

Don't waste any time playing this game, it is absolutely worthless.

"Tree of Saviour is one of the biggest letdowns I've come across my 15 years of playing MMORPGs.Although it's only ~1 year since the start of the Open Beta, the game managed to lose over 10k players in the first half year and another 2-3k until now. The reason for this are the neverending bugs, FPS issues with a mediocre graphic card [the minimum requirement stated on Steam won't even enable you to play the game], the horrible stat-balance [most stats are useless] and the non-existing Class balance [some Classes are so bad that you won't be able to take them to level 280+ content].The graphics look nice on the first view, but they are also the reason why this game has so many issues in the first place.They use up a lot of the graphic cards RAM because of the generated ""particles"" that form by movements,attacks,skills and environmental effects like dust clouds/candles/etc. This causes your FPS to drop a lot if your character is moving/taking some action, making it impossible to play with a low-standard graphic card. Once your FPS drop to a certain point [below 1], you have a high chance that the game client crashes on you.There are also many skills [mainly Cryomancer/Psychokino] which cause a similar effect by dropping your FPS below 1.The gameplay is getting incredibly boring once you've caught the gist of it.That's mainly because the monsters have an A.I. of a bath sponge. They will run beside you and start hitting you with normal attacks or try casting skills, which you can evade by simply moving backwards and/or to the sides.Even the bosses don't have any challenging tricks upon their sleeves; instead, their try to wear you down with their high damage magic and knockback/-down combos[which are quite frustrating once you get caught in them].The worst thing is that you can easily make them deal only 1 damage by slotting two five-star yellow gems into your armor and 2 five-star blue gems into your shoes, because every damage is reduced by your defence by a flat amount.This allows you to actively skip all trouble until you hit around level 280+...One of the worst things is the daily restriction on dungeon entries/daily mercenary post missions/Saalus convent, which are the most convenient way to level up and strenghen your equipment.It basically urges you to either grind&quest or wait for another day to run again.It gets boring very quickly because those dungeons&missions are extremely linear and don't have any great gains except for some RNG-bosscubes + a few silver per run.There are also many more restrictions, and if you don't pay for the premium service (i.e. ""Token""), you'll be even more limited with daily dungeon runs, market place useage and even personal trades. You're also unable to use the Team Storage, which allows all your characters to share their silver&equipment, if you run without a Token.It's also rather discriminating that you have to pay more $$$ for the same amount of TP (the ingame cash currency) if you come from Europe or North America than you have to pay if you come from a 2nd/3rd world country, regardless of which server you're actually playing on.About the general gameplay:It's fun while you're still leveling below level 270, although it's not really challenging. However, this game has way too many restrictions and too many silver sinks (to counter inflation I guess) for a casual player to enjoy the game. You're practically forced to farm tons of silver to buy attributes to make your skills stronger, to upgrade your equipment (which is quite expensive at higher levels, even at the lower stages/grades of upgrade), repeat daily Practonium quest until you get your Practonium to craft a ridiculously strong weapon for level 315+, repeat daily Saalus runs to get Blessed Shards to craft Blessed Gems which can be used to transcend your equipment to make it extraordinarily strong [a stage 10 transcended weapon is 6,5 times stronger than the basic weapon is] and farm tons of cards to upgrade your card/tons of gems/loot to upgrade your gems. So much grind just for one character. And because of the restrictions and RNGs involved, people are basically forced to run several characters at once just to build up one character. The 4 basic character slots are nowhere enough to become a decent player in less than one year with daily 3-5 hours dedication, so you better buy TP to increase your team slots.And, if you get a pet, it also counts as a character, so it uses up a slot,too, even if it's just a useless leg drag because the A.I. of the pets is even worse than the monsters A.I., causing a lot of bugs/errors.You just have to visit the forums of the game to get the gist of the terror the game is going to unleash onto you, so better get informed and prepared first if you want to play it. This is not Ragnarok Online, even if it looks similar.My advice: wait at least another year till you try the game. The developers have recently begun to tackle a few issues the game has, but they're nowhere near the point where this game is enjoyable. The rebalancing of basically everything seems to be planned [at least according to the recent player-developer discussion session in February 2017], so until then  it's better to stay away for your own good."
"I spent few hours playing Tree of Savior so I guess I should say something about why I probably won't run it again. There are problem with lags, but I already played MMORPG games with servers located all over the world so I guess I'm used to it, so it didn't affect me much but that could be a big problem for many. Modern Ragnarok Online? ToS might look nice and by looking at screenshots you can say ""Yeah, it looks just like new Ragnarok!"" but it's missing something - the soul. I'm not a big fan of Ragnarok and I missed the best years to play it, but I know that Tree of Savior isn't even close to be this game. It's missing something that would make it a fun MMORPG game to play - leveling isn't really fun, loot isn't really interesting and sometimes I just forget that I just got something from mobs. Besides the global chat, I had no chance to talk to anybody on field and many times I just felt like I'm playing a single player game made to be like MMORPG. So after a while, I'm just tired with this game. Tree of Savior is a free to play game, so the best you can do is try it out yourself."
"Elevator drops me everytime I try to go up. Stuck in dungeon forever. Would not reccomend.PS: You CAN'T change your name later, or at least not without paying. Don't fall for it like I did."
"IMC is holy crap company.They make all to bury game before F2P start, like:1. Trade restriction2. Trade restriction again(on new characters)3.

"I had hope for this game, but the servers are laggy and the customer service is horrible. I had a problem where I wanted to delete my account and start from scratch in a new one but you can't even do that."
"i'm day one player, i'm love this game, i'm really patient with this game but im done with imc's BS, on May 29 they revamp some function in the game with a promise give back 100% materials use on that function back, after the revamp some of us still not got our materials back, imc investigated for few hours then throw out a list of items that will got only 50% materials refund back on june 5 maintenance, it took me 4768 hours to farming all those materials now i had to pay 2384 hours of playing just bacause of their incompetent. Thanks imc, no wonder your playerbase drop so must in just 2 years."
"It's funny how people who rated the game as positive are those who haven't even reached at least lvl 240. If you're idea of having fun is grinding for hundred of hours and doing repetitive dungeons with recycled bosses, then I feel sorry for you."
"Way too much hate for poor reasons to be honest. Firstly the game aint laging that much anymore, they took off the server queues to test their maximum capacity that's the only thing that will drop your fps down to around 30fps cap or so. Also, all the classes are pretty well balanced with alot of variety around 80 of them and over 800 combinations.The game potential is really high and at the moment and premium doesn't make it a P2W title at all ! The only part that irritates me is that trading with players is only available with premium. They have a good reason for that though. Its to prevent bots from selling in-game money vs real cash.So in conclusion, dont take the reviews so seriously and try the game by yourself :)  8/10"
It's a pretty nice game visually. Don't play and expect not to spend some shekels when it goes f2p as this is a korean MMO with a cash shop.There's a good amount of lag issues and BR people so hopefully once the game goes live/f2p both of those problems will be fixed.
"The pay to win is strong!Pros - Good ArtDecent amount of class choices that actually feel/play differentlyCrafting system isn't overly complicatedCons - Token currently costs (18$ USD) as I am writing this which confers ""limited"" benefits.Cannot trade with anyone unless they have spent (30$ USD for a founders pack or 500k ingame currency for a token). This will change ofcourse to the previous amount I listed above once the game goes F2P.If you do not purchase a token you cannot enter dungeons more than once a day. Even with token ""benefits"" that limit rises to 3 per day.Posting stuff on the market takes 30mins-2hrs and you cannot retrieve the currency you gained through the market for atleast 48hrs.Cannot create guilds without an extreme amount of hassle due to them restricting it to an endgame class (the class is called Templar and in its current form its terriable).The biggest problem for me is that when you buy something from the market or trade a friend an item it immediately becomes ""untradable"". So you cannot buy your friend some crafting materials and then trade it to them.Giving items to other character on your account is extremely annoying as it stands you can only transfer ""1 item"" at a time unless you use excessive amount of ingame currency to expand your ""team storage""."
"It's a good game, but has some serious problems.As a game it's good. Combat feels good, classes are interesting, guild wars and bosses are fun and it looks beautiful. Now the reason for the low reviews is that it is managed so badly: 1. The clear balance issues on classes makes the combat unfair (anything past peltasta C1 in swordman tree doesn't matter. the whole class tree is a glorified aggroer/tank). 2. The game doesn't work with many people at the same time which makes guild wars and world bosses a slideshow.3. And lastly the bot prevention: doesn't seem to prevent it at all, but makes trading with other people a chore. Now despite this all, I still enjoy it. It's more of a good beta game, rather than a finished product and I'm fine with that. If you are too then I recommend the game to you, otherwise don't bother."
"Even though the game is crowded, resulting in a disadvantage for all ToS players due to lagging, it is a beautiful game to play, with an exciting soundtrack at all times and plenty of exploring to make your gaming experience worth it."
Product received for freeThis game? Yes it's fun to play even tho ya still need to do alot of grinding first to get where you want but the fact it's fun because of how we player able to do something how we wanna make our character gonna be like be creative about it.Bad part?How about make something about server problem and bot problem? Seriously tho. What's the point trying to play something that have quota limit of player while still bad lagged toward players and when being forced kicked out BAMMM in queue onward.. Overall would said 6/10 for this game if only this game doesn't have server problem issue that never yet settle until now especially having bots around.
I used to like the game a lot. but now.ever since its free to play every free loader has been swarming the servers like a cancerous blight.it makes the game quite unplayable in its current state. if its not lag and latency its the hundreds of trash running around KSing ya like noobs X.x avoid this like the pleague for now till the playerbase has dropped.Its a good game otherwise. just good not great or amazing.

"Looking for generic korean MMO that has barely anything special about it and always tries keep you busy with stupid boring and inane quests?Then you could play this game.There's lots of quests to do, one more boring and stupid than the other.Also this game just has major flaws in terms of design and technical difficulties.Prepare for massive lag, bugs and tons of bots"
"All the week one unplayable negative reviews are pointless.  The game is great, if you enjoyed RO you will enjoy this.  IMC is making changes and listening to the community every day, it has potential to be a long lasting and great PVE/PVP MMO"

"Keybinding is a f***ing nightmare, F2 is inventory. It doesn't overwrite the keys you bind. If you're left-handed, don't play it. UI can't be customized yet, you can't trade yet (it's released) and the task bar doesn't update your keybind. . ."
"Bad administration. Bugs after bugs, we basically can't play this game. I don't know why this game isn't a beta test, because  we paid and can not even play without disconnect or having issue.I NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANY FRIEND"
"It's not very well designed. ~This is a PvP game! You WILL be competing against other people for monster kills (kill steal is frequent) and bad luck if you have a support class that can't dish out a lot of damage! A DPS class can easily kill ten enemies in the time a priest takes to kill one.~There are some weird map designs, like going out of a zone on the left side of the screen and entering the new zone algo on the left side. You try to go right to continue walking but that takes you BACK to the previous zone. Some zones have exits that takes nowhere but looks like a regular exit, at first sight (like stairs going up taking you to new zones in one map and to nowhere in another).~Awful quests. You know you will  fight every single creature you see in a zone, sooner or later. And you have to find the quest givers first! The only way to know who will give you a quest is to talk to EVERY NPC to check if they have one. No way to know that beforehand, whatsoever.~You have to manually set you stats when you level up, even if you don't have a clear idea of what does what with what class you can take down the road. You can easily make an unplayable character and waste hundreds of hours.~I read somewhere that the story ends at some point and the only thing left is THE GRIND.~THE GRIND. Oh, the grind. Just the grind. Become a mindless drone.It's not a very good game, guys. If you feel Ragnarok nostalgia, check it out, but the game design evolved since those days and no lesson was learned here."
"I am a new player of TOS and I really liked the game. I like the storyline, graphic and the UI. I would even recommend this game. The only thing that keeps me from playing this game again is the continous errors. I've given this game a chance. First time I installed it, it didn't work. I deleted it because it takes a bigger space in my disk compared to other games Im playing. But since I really like to try the game, I reinstalled it. It worked and I fell in love with the game.  However, in the middle of the game, it stopped working and can't open it anymore. I waited for 2days because I thought that there was just a maintenance. After 2days, still no working and as I view the community and forums, I am not the only one experiencing the same issue.  I was able to find a fix posted by a player I guess. It worked but again in the middle of the game, I encountered the same error. TOS then again stopped working until now. Tried the fixes again but still not working. I am tired of reinstalling it as the time needed to complete downloading is very long. Thank you. I hope the error can be fixed some time. The game has big potential."
"It saddens me to not recommend this game, after years of waiting and finally playing BOTH the iCBT and Early Access, I think I have to say goodbye to this game.Pros:+ Great soundtrack. Boss battle with electronic/house/EDM vibes are the best.+ Great artstyle.+ Complex and unique class system. Theorectically you can build your character in many ways while progressing through ranks. Want stronger Swordman skill? No problem just choose Swordman again when you can class change. The choice is yours.Cons:- Linear map progression and quest chain. The only time you need to break the chain is when the quest chain dump you at a map with monsters waaay higher than your level at that time, in which the game technically force you to warp to another city to start ""another"" linear quest chain.- No map variety. They are either forest, cave, or dark underground temple.- Tons of grind, though for some this is not the problem.- Free to Play but Pay to Win. Token system sucks. Will have to wait and see how Cash shop will improve in the future.- Exploration was supposed to add some extra element from all the maps and quests repetition, but became tedious along the way due to stamina management and repetitive maps and monsters.- Stamina system. Who actually thought this was a good idea?So far I appreciate the SEA server that is coming AFTER the early access, but I'm gonna not recommend this to anyone at this moment. This is not the game that I've been hyping for years before.."
"When you join a Channel with low population, the lag is okay tbh. The game itself is a really fun MMORPG, I'm really not an MMORPG fan, but this game really caught my eye. It's a legend of a game, and I hope it gets more popular in future. It has a sick music base, and the classing system is really unique. Love it! <3"

"i cant understand all of these people who down voting a great game because of bugs and stuffs.. i mean, what would you expect from a game that was just launched recently? ofcourse bugs will be there and we need to help and report it for them to fix before the game goes live in a couple of weeks.."
"The first day of this game was really nice. but just after a few day of playing this game, it doesn't have that kind of a feeling that will keep you playing this game at all. (updated. the dev team and company of this game whoever in charge of iTOS is terrible at taking care of the server)"
"Although this game has many flaws, the game ITSELF is actually pretty good (but it IS a bit linear, and is more of a singleplayer game with friends than an MMO)...................It's just the HANDLING of the game that isn't (Server instability, bots, gold sellers, trade restrictions...etc).There isn't much more I can say about this game that hasn't been said already._________________________________________________________________________Verdict:_________________________________________________________________________IMC seems to be trying though, so if you have the patience to wait for more changes, this is probably a game worth your time (it's free anyways :D).But if you're looking to play a polished game with minimal flaws......this game will frustrate you to no end."
"At May 6th the game is unplayable. The ""new"" Silute server for Latinamericans is horrible: you are disconnect 50% of the times you move to a new map or you select a character. Some times you cannot enter to the server. I'm asking my money back."
"Product received for freeIt is beautiful, it has a great soundtrack, i like the controls, i like the original story from an unexplored mythology (lithaunian) and i like the huge and complex class trees.I will never understand the kids that ragequit at every single small problem AND leave an negative review."
"Product received for freeGreat Visuals, Good gameplay,Bad servers, especially in europe, I would like to see them fixed, especially in populated areas the lag is heavy.Overall its a fun game."
For some poeple i think they can't play or download this game thats why its getting a bad reviews but if im going to be honest here this game is beautifuly well made and as you play you can feel the vibe of the anime Grimar and the realistic gameplay where skill is not the only option you have and you must rely on friends from time to time.give it a try and check for solutions for those who can't open the game because it crashed.
I don't know why this game get's some bad reviews. Beautiful art style and everything you'd expect from MMO mechanics. Game play was straightforward and fluid. Some of the music is very good. So easy just to jump in and play for a bit. What do people want for free? Give it an hour or two and form your own opinion.
Product received for freePatcher/Launcher seems to have issues starting up the game properly. Other then that I'm a fan of the game so far. Use to play Ragnarok Online a lot. Still do. Reminds me of it sorta.
I played in the SEA server and it is really laggy. Not recommend for people who has problem like me. I am sure it is not about my internet speed. Too bad the server cant handle much
I love this game.  Sadly I can not - in its current state- suggest it to others.  There are a lot of lingering issues that make it hard to digest.PROSThe music is fantastic.The art style is beautiful; easy to stare at for long periods of time.Combat (pvp) is interesting with all the various class build options and quicky interacions between skills.CONSThe crafting system is dull; lacks vision for long-term player community.Seriously painful delays with resolving arrising bugs. 
"Cute and charming art style, inviting class system with a ton of variety, and fun gameplay.I like that I can play with a controller pretty seamlessly, though choosing a target with it is sometimes a pain. The party system has been great for my husband and I so far.The amount of build options is almost daunting! Luckily making a new character and leveling a bit is pretty quick! Not overly grindy so far, thanks to in-game quest rewards.Overall, I'm having a ton of fun with this game!"
"this is from 10+ hours in to the game. I am about level 50. I also like pretty grindy game if they are somewhat entertaining, or as a good social experience. This game is buggy. I would advice to avoid the kinetic class from the wizard tree. I picked that one. and had a lot of buggy spells. :( I don't know how well they fix bugs in this game. they may be bad at it. I have encountered a few bugs, most fixed by just going back to character screen and logging back in, the plus side is that it takes just a couple of seconds to do. Why is it positive review you may ask? well for started I don't believe the score atm is fair. It should be just a bit higher. Actually the music alone is probably why, ♥♥♥♥ing amazing music holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ play this game even if you think it is horrible for just a couple of hours of just amazing music. That being said. I do enjoy the game so far atleast. some other minor issues is that this game would probably be a great social experience, pretty important in a MMORPG in my opinion. Buuut. The lack of actuall humans are a tiny problem to say the least. But who knows maybe the playerbase will eventually grow. What I've heard is that the game seems to be improving lately. I don't know didn't play back then, just started yesterday. The art style is pretty cute. if you like Anime. Level cap is like 300+ so if you like leveling. This may be your jam. I do. So it is my jam. For now. The game difficulty seems to be getting progressivly more difficult after level 40. But maybe that is just my bad skill build. I know if you want to play support, and just be a team player, the lack of human players may be an issue. Easiest solo class is definetly swordman. Play swordman if you are solo. Don't play support cleric as I tried. You will have a bad time solo. But if you do find party members, go for it. I think you will have a great time. This game has flaws. But it has charm. music is good, art is good. Gameplay is good, if you count out the bugs. But... You mostly can't. And this is like old classic mmorpgs, if you build your character wrong from the beginning, you are cucked. Reroll. I think you can reset skills if you pay cash. But I don't know. The cash shop is hard to find (what) and barely any items in it."
"Nice game.PRO: - 80+ Classes to chose from, much freedom, can make a class that nobody has (secretly achievable classes) - Much opportunity to become rich, easily farmed low lvl items can be sold for much on the market. - Huge world map, spend hundreds of hours and you will not see it all. - Crafting, Enhancing, Enchanting, something every MMORPGer loves.CONS: - 80+ Classes to chose from, chose a wrong combination and you are f*cked late game,Example: Swordsman that has no ""Taunt"" class has a very difficult time finding a party late game. - Party dependant - past lvl 210 It turns extremely difficult and inefficient to solo, hence you will need to find a good party to grind with. - Grinding: If you do not fancy spending 5-10 hours daily on the same spot killing the same mobs over and over again, this game might not be for you. - HUGE Trading limitations, here are some examples:* No trading/selling/buying from the market first 72 hours of the game.* When you sell something, takes 48 hours for you to receive the money.* If you trade 1:1 the traded item becomes untredable (unless you use a Token)* Anything that you buy off the market that is not equipment (Materials, Potions etc) becomes untradable.- Cash Shop is garbage, also no real way to spend real money to buy cash shop currency, and when they do implement a way, its going to be a stupid one, where you buy a once per account steam bundle, its as if the company that owns the game hates money.Lots more to say about the game, good and bad, but for some reason I really enjoy playing, so its really up to you."
"Product received for freeSetting aside the amount of bugs, errors, and premium features for payers, it is an otherwise good game, being free-to-play (F2P) and all...Fix all the bugs and errors and offer more features for F2P players, I would recommend it."
"Cant even play the game since i can not change the keybindings. I wanted to change normal Attack from z to Ctrl and jump to alt, won´t work. I even tried to change the bindings in the hotkey.xml, won´t work either. I changed the other keys using ctrl and alt, but the changes simply don´t apply. Now every thing is completely screwed up and although it is reset to default i can´t even attack with z anymore. I have never experience this kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sure it was released just a short while back but come on... haven´t even had that much trouble with the controls of games in alphas. I am pretty sure even I can program a simple script to change keybindings... but that´s just one mans opinion."
"1. English is not my first language.2. Im fan of old Ragnarok Online, and when I come to TOS, I found myself back time, thinking all days long for a proper build.3. The gameplay is fun, quest and dungeon party oriented. Most of the time I need party is to do quest, so I dont need to compete with others. Quest is also good, most is collection style that you need X of Y or kill N monster name ZZZ, but some are really fun that transform you into monster or brain wash them to kill themselve.4. Most of the ugly part in this game is about hard ware system. But the game is still in early state so I suggest players to be patient and make room for developers to fix what is broken.5. Game design is perfect in TOS. Must play for 2.5D style MMO."
"The opinions about this game kinda crashing together.All I can really tell you is try it for yourself. In about a week or smth this game is going to be free to play.In my opinion the issues with botters, gold sellers and performance is real but nothing what is kinda different to other MMOs I played. And there is a patch incoming with allowing for better trade options and so on, so they are working to improve the game.There is stuff which could be better, like the social part of this game. In most cases you walk either with a friend or alone. But the gameplay itself is very polished, there are tons of classes/builds and skills to combine, I really love that system (kinda like ArcheAge but you have to circle through 7 classes).To give you a small sum up:PROS:- Tons of classes to choose and develop- Ragnarok similar art style modernized- Really awesome controller support (play it with a PS4 controller), feels like playing Breath of Fire 4.- For a F2P game there is atm. not much to call it pay to win, there is actually just one item which gives you great benefits but you are able to buy it with the ingame currency from players.- Even thou the maps are a bit linear, there are many and big one, so it fills the gap.- ""Endcontent"" Earth Tower which is comparable to Sword Art Online's Castle, you have to climb up and as far as I know the highest level reached is 20 so far (I could be wrong with this information)- No real level cap, the soft cap is at around 270 at the moment- Stat point allocation, so many MMOs dropped that system which makes me kinda sad because I had to define my character with equipment only, but not here. There is a good balance betweet equipment stats and the ones you picked.CONS:- Regular performance drops. While I have most of the time 120+fps there are recent drops for like half a second to like 15fps. This really has to be fixed.- The character customization is actually not really existent. You can choose boy/girl and one of like 6 hairstyles. That is kinda lame.- Kill stealing. For me personally this is nothing new because I played Lineage2 for like 8 years, but it is kinda annoying in this generation of MMOs- Bots & Goldseller. While they are annoying, bots are kinda more polite than most players, because they don't kill steal :D- Class balance. There are few classes which really have to get more love, like the summoner for example- Lone wolf MMO, there has to be more social stuff to care about in this game. While I like the public party system (you see parties with open slots nearby) this is not enough. I mean Ragnarok was like a freakin MMODRPG (massive multiplayer online dating role play game), but I don't see it even close here.So why do I recommend this game?You know I started with hundreds of new MMOs and saw how they launched, in most cases it was always chaos and stuff that should be different. Even GW2 had a crap start with hundreds of gold sellers or FFXIV with servers all the time down and queries to the moon for joining the game. With this one it does not feel much different. YES there are issues which needs to be adressed asap, but you can see and play so much content for an inofficial Ragnarok 2.5. Give this game a try and the developers some love and I'm pretty sure you might enjoy it a lot ;)"
"Quick Review-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥love this game, give it a try if you like to try out many classes.PROS-So many jobs-Many places to explore + good reward for exploring the world-Cute characters-The game start you out with pretty good equipment that last for awhile (note: it's limited time for 30days)-It is easy to make decent money for gearsCONS-Fk this laggggg soooo muchhhhhhh!-Too many jobs can be pretty overwhelming-Token system, which is premium, that you either buy from other player (expensive) or buy it with your IRL money.-End game is WAY too pricey (in game money)-Walking distant from quest to quest is pretty annoying..."
"Having trouble downloading 11035 _001 001.pak, it keeps failing.. or is just because of the 4 hour delay of their server they said... anyhow waiting till this gets fixed before I can rate this game a thumbs up....Edit: Managed to get it work by hours of searching for solutions online. There is only 1 solution I found on my problem but still this issue is frustrating since when I got it to work it starts downloading patch at around 6:30 when servers are up... Then I get to load the game and create character then another frustrating thing is the server queue. It takes a long time to get into the game , for me it took about an hour just to finish the queue. But the game looks good so I rate it now thumbs up now even though I lost my hours spent around this game just fixing, patching and waiting.Edit 2: Great MMORPG game but the only problem I have with this is the FPS drops/Low FPS."
"Lag, lost connection, terribly low fps in town, made-up restrictions on item transfer, SPAM, pay for everything. no decent item distribution system in groups (no need/greed/random - always gets the top damager), ... PAID BETA.UPD: Some updates regarding channel-wide bot ads were made, but bots get to level 40 easily and continue spamming. Loot distribution system was fixed, which is good. Can't recommend yet.UPD2: Controls are terribly f**ked up meaning instead of using mouse mode, you are FORCED to use keyboard or gamepad to proceed with some quests because quest items have NO use prompts. Therefore, you have to switch to keyboard/gamepad, activate the trigger, switch back to mouse. Until you are forced to do that again in the next quest that doesn't work."
"Awesome game, even though many players are unhappy, me and my friends have been enjoying it, IMC has been listening to the playerbase for most of the issues, overall i'm sastified with the game cause it gives me a fresh feeling in a mmorpg since WoW & Guild Wars 2."
"The game is good. The communication with the playerbase is horrible. The early acess period had a lot of connection problems and misinformation regarding this issues (created, of course, by the horrible community management from IMC Games). Now, after a mass server transfer, the Staff, for more than a week, simply ignored the concerns and warnings of connection issues from thousands of players from their South America Server, resulting in Founders stuck in login screens for more than 5 days and a lot of new SA players that cannot connect. We are left in the dark, and just got a series of superficial information and excuses about the problem in the past couple of days. So, if you are from South America, play at your own risk."
"I couldn't manage to enter the game dispite i spent almost 10hours figuring it.. Steam used to have really stable platform, i guess is IMC problem den. might come back after half year.. see if the problem still exist"
"So I played this back in early access March/April 2016 for a little bit, it was fun enough so I decided to buy a founder's pack or 2 for it. I only played for a little while, getting to around level 40 and I tried maybe one party quest before dropping it for other games.Fast forward to today and I decide to give it another go, only to find I can't log in to the game because my account access is now restricted. I submit a ticket and receive a reply in 10 minutes telling me that I have violated terms of service and EULA. The entire response seems like an automated reply. I submit a second ticket asking if I can at least be told how I've earned a ban, again to get what looks like an automated reply within 10 minutes saying ""We would like to inform you that we are unable to provide any information regarding with your concern about the account suspension. Due to security reason regarding with the violation that caused your account to be suspended.""The thing is, I didn't even submit my characters names on the tickets because it had been so long I couldn't remember, but they can apparantly tell me with complete certainty that I'm right to be banned after looking into it for 5 minutes.Play at your own risk but this seems like another opportunistic F2P cash grab"
"This game i will admit has some bugs. I would be happy if they fixed the AMD headspinning glitch and FPS Optimization.But, besides all that i can say this is an extremely fun game and definitely one of my all time favorites to date.Looks like HD Ragnarok Online which is another one of my favorite games. Plays like a mix of Diablo, Fable, RO, and Phantasy Star Online 2 all rolled into one with a classic grind feel. Musical score reminds me of .hack with a tinge of RO and SAO elements to it. All these things sums up to one amazing gem. Pros Definitely outweigh the Cons. My Friends agree on all of these things and i now have them addicted. Many complain. I am very happy this game exists and will be working hard to build my character."
"This game had so many problems when it first launched and couldnt handle very well the huge amount of players hyped for the release but things have become steadily better and right now is the time to take it for a test, its FTP after all."
"Lots of potential.It's just that, the game is really unstable and unbalanced right now that it's really a waste of time to invest and grind all the way only to realize that they will be changing/balancing some stuff the next maintenance.  Also, there was some point where the devs has ridiculous ways/ideas on how to implement things. Especially on how they came up with the idea of punishing RMT players via implementing a stupid trading policy which didn't just punished the RMT people, but also the normal ones lmfaoIt's really sad that it has come down to this. I really liked the game that much but the people who were handling it isn't fit for the job. (in my opinion)"
Here we go with ridiculous server issues again after regular weekly maintenance... Love the game to peaces... but I'm about to move over to Korean servers since I dont seem to have this many problems...
"Product received for freeTook bad things from RO and make it worse, also killed the good things in process.Here's random bad taste left in my mouth.- Discourage social interaction in many ways.- Linear quests for hundreds of level, no point asking someone to play together most of times.- Super restricted economy look like you buy and sell with NPC rather than actual person.- If they want to create gap between free and premium player, how about adding something worth money instead of taking away standard feature found in every other F2P MMO?- No funny experiment with class or skill, it's either buy real money item to reset or start new charactor to run all those tedious quests again, for hundred hours."
"After stopped playing the games for months in hope they fixed them issues on the game.Came back to see if there's any improvement, not only things are still not fixed, but dungeons are absolurely empty, waiting for an hour queue but never got a group, played for another 2 hours until I got absolutely bored yet again.Checked the stat on player count and it can't even reach 5k people playing for the last month. Yeah for a MMO game, this game is empty. Unless you're a solo player who enjoys seeing bots here and there. Avoid this game."
"This review is based around the game as of 4/26/2016Don't believe the negativity; and let me get the negatives out of the way first, this game does not have lag issues, and no it is NOT Pay2Win.With that out of the way, Tree of Savior (ToS) is a very beautiful and fun game, very much akin to the days of Ragnarok online, it is a 2.5D MMORPG, and is literally the spritual successor to Ragnarok Online. There are so many class varieties and builds, garaunteed to satisfy anyone from softcore to hardcore gamers. Leveling speed is pretty quick, you level your physical level and your class seperately, but simultaneously. Story quests give you multitudes of items, specifically things called ""Exp Cards"" which give chunks of exp to both class and physical levels to help speed leveling along at a semi-casual pace, but most importantly, levels as of now, feel like they matter and took time, when I see a lvl 200+ I actually feel impressed.The story so far (lvl 50 as of writing this) is pretty decent, nothing spectacular, etc, generic MMO story for the most part (thus far mind you)Graphics are amazing. The watercolor paint inspired character art and graphics are amazing and breathtaking.The sound and music are very good, especially for a MMORPG. Each area has a pretty catchy tune associated with it, and abilities, feel very heavy and hardhitting which is a very good plus, stocks sounds are at a minimum here.Last but not least, the cash shop, it offers pay4convenience and in no way is Pay2Win (at least as of writing this review) I hope you'll check this game out, it definitely deserves some love!"
"As of May 16th this game has been fine tuned and completely changed the balance and performance of the entire game experiance. If you haven't given this game a shot or tried it at launch and just weren't a fan because of bugs or poor optimization. Pick this game up, and revisit it. I'm sure you'll enjoy your time here and be giving this game a well deserved thumbs up.10/10 "
"I'm sorry to say all the bad ratings are true. Here's my experience up to level 36:-Story makes little sense, and isn't worth reading almost immediatley.-The translation is iffy at best, even untranslated at times (that's what you get when you don't pay your translators).-The layout of all of the maps feel exactly the same. So rather than getting excited reaching a new level area, it feels depressing.-All the bosses act almost entirely the same.-Some classes just don't function well the way mobs work in game. Meaning, you could need to start over entirely if you picked the wrong one.-Targeting is probably the worst I have seen in a modern MMO. You'll constantly waste SP shooting off screen, or hit the wrong mobs entirely.-I have seen more botters than I have seen real players. It feels like a 10 year old MMO, where the entire community has left except for bots (this is not an exaggeration).-The market issus is pathetic. I NPC nearly everything, and save just the best for trade. However, I have made no friends, or even got a response from anyone in game because of the above mentioned bot problem.-There are not actually 80 classes. There are 4 classes (archer, warrior, healer, mage) with different skill sets. So, there really isn't any way to make any sort of creative build that crosses these barriers like a battle mage, or a trap healer, etc..-Every map constantly lags and tears at the screen, even when there is no one there.-Moving between maps is really awkward.-Mobs feel like the same thing, over and over, just reskinned.-The spawn rate on some maps is extremely slow. I'm writing this close to 4 months after release, and absolutely no one was on the channel I was in, yet I would walk around for minutes on end not finding any spawns at all. You have to play on channel 1 or 2, just to get any sort of spawn. The rest are apparently for botters that don't seem to mind the long wait.This game looked as if it would have been like Ragnarok. However, it's only good in it's appearance. This was one of the most pathetic MMOs I have seen in a long while. I expect it to be shut down within 2 years."
too many restrictions 48 hours waiting to get silvers from market wtf?bots in every♥♥♥♥♥♥♥map goldsellers spamming everywhere even in pm!!!!and what IMC do instead of taking care of those bots and gold seller they add more restrictions to trading and add new costumes in TP shop....besides from that the game is nice though.
"Game ran OK for a few days, but now I can't get the game to launch at all.  It just gose to the update screen and then fails to start.  Nothing works and the game will not start so I can not recommend spending any money on the game it's way to buggy."
I love love love playing this game!Super 100%!It has a lot of classes to choose from (you are not bounded w/ just 1 job)Rich storyline and the art work is so amazing!Much love to this game! ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥
Bot Haven.Bots... Bots everywhere. Don't bother with this one. No point in farming for items to sell in the market as it is plagued by items farmed by bots for lower prices. Most of the areas are also plagued by a♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of bots. Then you got your chat window filled with tons of tons of gold spammers flooding the life out of your window. 
"First off, I absolutely LOVE Tree of Savior. It really had a ton of potential to be a great game. Unfortunately the company running it has caused problems and ruined their own game. The combat style is fun, but allows every player to afk farm certain mobs (due to static respawn points) by simply setting a book on their attack key. There is no forced logouts, which means (you guessed it) bots are RAMPANT. Half the players you meet will seemingly teleport around your screen and attack mobs before you can, or you are simply fighting them for spawns. This problem is awful from level 15-40. The bots seem to die off a bit after that, but I haven't made it to max level to see what that is like.IMC has done NOTHING about their botting problem, nor about the pretty toxic playerbase whom are pretty awful at the best of times, I can only imagine their attitude is due to their profits. Someone is supplying these people with tokens, be it themselves or others, and they are getting paid. The economy is a joke, and the restrictions placed on trading an item or using their auction house are god awful. I really enjoy their game, but until the botting problems and gold spammer problems are fixed a bit, I can't recommend this game to other people, which is such a shame. If you made it this far, I'll share some of the things I love and hate.-There is quite a lot to do-The art and music are AMAZING. Totally my style. -The combat is fun, but if you lag with a melee class you will be VERY annoyed in short order. (Most of my lag is due to my poor internet connection, not the servers but the punishment from the lag is totally lost melee attacks. Like, I attacked, I saw my character swing his weapon... and NOTHING happens. Unless you attack 2+ times, this will happen with a bad connection and you will almost always lose that first attack.)-Real-money is the ONLY option for resetting your skills or stat points, not sure if thats good or bad tbh. Choices matter, but ehh should be in-game option.-Sadly, you are locked into your class choices. If you pick the wrong class, or the class you picked turns out to not be so fun ONE time... Guess what? Better start over. Even if you are level 200 and simply made a bad call or thought something worked a different way.-There are very few resources for information. I know this is due to how new the game is but, because of the beta testing, a lot of information you find is old and has since been changed. Even trying to research a good class selection or which stats to pump at max level is next to impossible. Which is why I feel being locked into class choices is such a bad idea."
"Just a few word to say,Poor attempt to bring back those Ragnarok Online memoriesImbalance classes, game engine not optimized, bug ridden game, gold farmers, boss campers and repeatitive gameplay mechanics that make this game far inferior compare to World of Warcraft"
"If the performance of this game was sorted out, I would very easily recommend this, but as it almost crashes my laptop on a regular basis and has big FPS drops for no reason, I'm afraid I just can't. Overall it seems a genuinely good game, and I love the art style, I'm just really disappointed with how it performs. Sort it out, and I will happily come back to the game. If you are happy to play a good game that crashes and drops frames alot, then I recommend this"
"The game itself is fine. Quite enjoyable, even if it can get a little grindy and is pretty linear in terms of gameplay.However what ultimately made me quit is the server, the lag/delay is rediculous (EU server).Skills taking longer to load up than they should and you sometimes get stuck at the end of the animation. Accepting/finishing quests has a delay of atleast 3-10 seconds depending on how the server is feeling.There is always Noticable lag/delay.The game could still be enjoyable to people that can coop with this, but I advice anyone who is even slightly sensative to lag to stay away from this game it will get on your nerves.I will quite happily come back to this game as soon as the servers get sorted out, but I'm not expecting much from a company that doesnt work weekends(wtf?!) and has not even acknowledged the fact that there are some huge problems with the server.Also ♥♥♥♥ YOU NEXON YOU PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥PUBLISHER"
"Certainly the game has a great potential.   We can consider the game as the  true ragnarok online 2.  Beautiful graphics , great music , a lot of classes to choose , huge variety of enemies and a great art in general  .  But,  at his current state, it has a lot of bugs. And when i´m saying a lot of bugs, we´re talking about tree of savior as  an unfinished game.  Bugs, Lag,  cheaters . And more  bugs.  Tree of savior should be fixed. In fact, They should have taken a couple of months to finish the game and not release it in his current state. Therefore ,   It´s almost unplayable and i can not recommend it to everyone."
"If you ever played RO, this is very nostalgic and beautiful. I felt in love for this game from the very Beta, but, after release and after it was open as a Free to Play game, the full experience is laggy, I get disnconnected from the game very often and, the worst part: There is a queue for entering the server everytime you get disconnected. It´s unplayable for me, and this really saddens me."
"Serious this is the price of your medicore at best subscription?Tree of Savior - Beginner's Pack for NA Servers 29.99Tree of Savior - Veteran's Pack for NA Servers 34.99a wise man once told me... ""BLOW IT OUT YOUR♥♥♥♥♥quot; "
"This is by no means a comprehensive review, nor a professional one. I payed $10 for the 'founders access', and played TWICE for a total of 8 hours during that time. that's how unstable the game was. I've been playing on the EU server.Once the game went free, two of my friends joined in and we've played a bit here and there. We're all about level 30's (so no, wer'e not endgame, or even to the point where most players consider the ""Real game"" to be... But in that time i've seen horrendous lag and rubberbanding, as well as a 'team' of ten characters all running the same path and using skills in unison (Multiboxing or botting, your pick)Aside from the absurd number of goldsellers, there doesn't seem to be much community on the EU server that i can tell. And i imagine what community there is, is all at the higher levels and such.and now i see they have DLC content... for the NA servers only... and then somethign about restricting access to new players to fix issues...I see people saying ""this is the real RO2""... I played RO... this does not feel the same. at all. RO (as i knew it) wasn't a 'you're useless if you're not <insert class here> with this special build!' RO was also playable with mouse and keyboard. I've tried both the keyboard and mouse controls for this, and they're hideous for me. I have to play with a controller, using my mouse for menu actions.All in all, i cannot recommend this game, sinply for all the stability issues, not to mention the bots and goldsellers and the gameplay restrictions placed to discourage those."
"Horribly made, so buggy. nothing at all like ragnarok as i was consistantly promised by friends and online reviews. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ made game by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev, crappy f2p model not enough quest at level 70 onwards, it does have some elements of ragnarok but it lacks A LOT in many other parts. Classes aren't that well explained, and over all spell usage can leave you fustrated with long♥♥♥♥♥cooldowns wasting your time."
"♥♥♥♥ this game its was soo♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥good like how can something like this die so quick i was so hipe but then when i played it , it was so♥♥♥♥♥♥like damm lag everywhere slow moveents and the fell of a browser game"
"The developers never adressed its many problems from their open beta's (including that burning trash heap otherwise called early access) and the game itself is just a hand holding grind from 1 area to the next..But the lag, the bugs, the bots, the lies..It's such a freaking mess..Don't try it out because it's free, there's just nothing... "
"This game is a game killing simulator developed and played by IMC Games.The game that were a heaven during the closed beta, turned into a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when the open beta came, and to make things better, instead of fixing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, the developers decided to release cash shopcostumes and do trivial changes in the game, completelly ignoring the player base complaints.If you have the chance of trying the game, you must know that this game have no reasons to play in party, unless for dungeons or around higher level grinding (just like other games).This game, like Dungeon and Fighters, is another game that made me feel betrayed, because I liked the experience on the closed beta, hundred of hours were expent playing this awesome game, and all that be destroyed in a beta stage.Congratulations IMC Games for killing another game.Edit:. To add to the sum, every new patch of rework to systems, promissing to fix game issues, seems to make the game more and more unplayable for low end players, before I could play the game, being that after several hours of gameplay, glitched textures and crashes happened, now, I can't even enter Klaipeda because I get instant crash, If I walk half of the map, or even start a quest that spawns a boss, that the game crashes, and there are already glitched textures after logging in a char on the map, be it a buff or the minimap, or even the chat itself, It's unplayable!What The IMC?Edit:. There is something to be added to the sum, gradually the game system requirements rises, before I could login in the game and play through a few maps before graphical glitches happened and the game crashed, now, at the character selection screen the graphical glitches begins happening, and the game crashes after reaching the middle of the loading bar after selecting a character."
"leveling is annoying, you have to save your exp tomes (you dont get experience from quests directly, quests give you exp tomes which you use like an item and you gain exp from it) and use them at certain levels because of the leveling curve makes certain levels level really slowly, so you use the tomes on those levels. Why cant we just level normally across the board??Also gets really laggy at times where you want 30 seconds for an npc to respond so you can turn in a quest/buy something/ or even use an item for a quest. You constantly switch channels in hopes of finding one that isnt laggy."
"Pick the server I want, click Enter. Connecting to the server... ""Login Error""Click Enter again, wait 30 seconds, nothing happens.Spam click Enter, finally get into server.Pick my character, click Start Game, nothing happens.Click Start Game again, wait 30 seconds, nothing happens.Spam click Start Game.... Nothing. Go to Exit and it zones me in finally.Run around in town, stutter lag, full main hubs turn into a slideshow.Decide to switch characters, so I click Switch Characters... ""Login Error""Flip keyboard, Exit Game.Id rather drop a load in my pants than play this sometimes, though, it seems like it would be fun once they sort out their issues.And theres a lot to sort out."
"Comfy grinding sim with great visuals, music, and infinite build possibilities with an old school RPG spirit. Very addicting.F2P is a bit limited when it comes to trading and alts though, be wary of that.EDIT: The limitation of not being able to transfer items within your own alts without a premium token is going away, but the 1:1 trading between two players will remain blocked."
Product received for freeIt's not perfect but very fun to play and it's a very social game.  I never played Ragnarok Online and I think that's a good thing because people who played Ragnarok Online expect this game to be just like it but even better and that's an unrealistic hope.  There is a bit of a grind here and there but the xp system in this game is not linear so it's a fresh take and I like it.
Great game but with poor Devs:- You should ban/clear the Bot and gold spammer not with the restrictions- Free to play server down for many hours no matter many posts from the players to forum the devs still quite about it and wont give a single answer what a great support- Lag + bugSince you can't even access to the forum normally so i have to post this here. 
"This game has had a rocky start since F2P launched. Once they fixed one area, they messed up another. Never in my MMO life have I seen developers do more maintenance in a week.As of the time of this rant, my game was updated but in-game it still says there a new update and launcher needs to shut down.GG, IMCGames. G.G.At its current state, I can't recommend anyone playing this game, don't matter if you're a HUGE fan of Ragnarok Online."
"Poorly optimized and clearly unfinished game banking purely on nostalgia. From the horridly bad damage calculations, the linear progression and poor class balance it's like IMC was pressured into releasing the game like this.If you can look past all that you'll find it as just a grindy cutesy MMO for a niche market. Still has lots of room to improve."
"Firstly i want to say that i actually really like this game, the art looks awesome and the variety of builds with various classes is amazing!!! Tos is apparently very grindy but i think that makes the back bone of the game it allows you to set goals for the development of your character, its old style is honeslty quite refreshing.which is why it is so frustrating i cant actually play the game due to server issues.. slow connect times, being kick out constantly and even having to queue up to enter a server.. So in short the reason i would not recommend Tos currently isnt because of the game itself but because of the technical issues (servers) surrounding it  which depending on where you live leave the game completely unplayable.."
"What can i says The game is good, I adore their Creativity and also their workBut The problem is the one WHO manage this gameThey are an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, DUMB , and seem to be the main factor of TREE OF FAILURELOOK HOW THEY MANAGE WITH THE BOT, Hacker and Money seller LET THEM COME ruin everything??   Put on restrictions that don't solve any thing but increase more damm problem?? or Solve by open it free then ban them??? and those botter just open new id and return the cycle... with more cash in their handTons of bug, 5 of 8 charactor in charactor creation still headless like dullahan, half of player and npc still like that after 2 month pass ..... no solution at all!! Server lag like hell, it's takes 5 sec to cast an instant spell!! or flashing warp 4 times before u reach like 5 meters and now they just increase those problem for Founder like us by open free to play!! in TelsiaiOMG There're tons of better way to slove this.I don't have problem to P2P even it's go on monthly+ game costConclusionI suggest not to play thisit's better to hope of some server like Japanese server, at least those guys seem smarter and more caring to customer..  "
"Adorable, but kind of scary class system where choices in class combinations appear to be permenant which I can see being a problem with certain choices being seen as non-viable by the general community. It reminds me of old-school jRPG's and Ragnarok Online. The sprite art style is awesome. Compatible with a controller. I can see this game having a lot of potential, as of right now I've only played for a couple of days, and the leveling/progression system seems pretty standard for an MMO, I think a game like this could benefit from a strictly skill-based system rather than level-gainining one which I can see potentially becoming very grindy. But people have gotten to lv.280 relatively quickly so I could be wrong."
" Good game recommended to those who love Old MMO .-Good Graphics , Many ways to build your Character , Huge Maps to explore and many others.-All i can say is try it and decide for yourself. That is the only way you will know whether you enjoy it or not"
"The game is not going to be for everyone, no doubt about it. All i can say is please try it yourself if you are in doubt, you might just love it. I dont feel that the ""10 hours played"" reviews could possibly have enough insight as to what is good or bad with the game. I would suggest you read the ones with at least 100+ hours invested.Pros+ Graphics, i just like this oldschool style. Very cute.+ Soundtracks are awesome, especially in some places !+ Combat is fun, and different.+ Community, ive only met nice people this far, seriously.+ Alot of different paths you can build your character, tho some are ""cookie cutter"" (but thats always the case)+ Huge world map with many different layouts.+ Tons of Boss battles.+ You can be a tank, healer, buff supporter, caster, ranger, ""totem"" user, Melee. Just about anything you can think of.+ Skins of customes for different classes look really cool, some more then others ofc :)+ IMC. Yes they are truly listening to the community, they have improved the game massively already in manydifferents areas. Mobs respawn rate, Trading for none token users, compensation for unexpected maint, to name a few.Cons- The main thing is just opimization. The game has FPS issues for some reason. Its weird, annoying and its bad.- Bots. I havent noticed it alot out in the world fighting monsters. In towns and in all chat its constant spam tho.- Game freezes for a short duration sometimes, for example when opening the world map.- The chat itself is pretty buggy sometimes.- Huge buffs and nerfs back and forth, making and breaking builds. - Trade restrictions- AH- Class advancement, if you chose wrong, there is no going back.- Targeting can be a bit annoying (using mouse and keyboard) Even certain quest items are unclickable in mouse mode.- Class balance. Everyone has something that make them special and good for grouping, however some supports simply cannot solo level at a certain point. DPS classes can kill a quest boss in seconds, for me as a support wizard some of them took up to 20min, and there were quests or bosses i simply could not do.All said, its really fun, and even tho there still are issues, the game is only getting better each patch. "
God awful trade and market restrictions.  Lots of lag and unstable servers. Botters/hackers killing everything in a field.  Bugs that were present in beta are still here.  I wanted so bad for this game to succeed but IMC clearly only cares about cashing out as quickly as possible.  RIP TOS
"Besides some bugs here and there (come on, the game just launched), it's a LOT of fun, i've been having a blast :3The game's trade restrictions are directed at preventing gold sellers. What most people don't seem to understand is that the inconvenience presented by not being able to trade the in-game currency and having to wait to take the money out of the auction house is much better than having gold sellers going rampart. I'm talking from past experience here: people are willing to drop thousands upon thousands of dollars in games, and almost 100% of the time in illegal RMT. You may not have been introduced to this kind of environment yet, but it's really common (especially in korean MMOs) to have people dropping absurd amounts of money to obtain insane gear and basically 1-shot everything, one of the most recent korean blockbusters (the one that starts with arche) had several problems with this kind of attitude, which led the game to its partial death.Please understand that this MINOR inconvenience is going to help this game's economy and make it keep on being fun for a long time."
"This Review isn't really long, very simple just spaced out by category, go ahead and expand it and enjoy.*Warning: Plebs on the forums are ragers with little patience and lack propper understanding of the games mechanics.Website for practicing Class Progression (Too many ragers crying because they dont know how to google helpful things!) =>>> http://www.tosbase.com/tools/skill-simulator/  The game is a solid, having that said, it is in its early phases and the company is patching it constantly before its initial release.Review:[Gamplay and Performance]- Over all, its clean cut, killing monsters is very satisfying, leveling up is not a chore. The Questline is a story you experience and is very enjoyable. The game is very engaging and there are lots of bosses to fight in the game. The gameplay is simple its easy enough for beginners to start playing RPG games yet complicated enough for the competetive player to have the resources they need , to go far PVE and PVP wise.[Visuals and Music]- Have you ever played, "" Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicals"", some time in your life? The visuals and initial feel of the game has a very artistic and familiar feel to FFCC, it's very pleasant and very fitting. The Art style used in the game can be very compelling and give you sense of peace and then do a 180 and pump you up with great Power Metal Electro beats when doing a dungeon. It's hard not to be moved by the game on your first time playing it.[Game Mechanics] The game is a meta breaker, it changes the way you view class progression as a whole, usually class progression is linear But this game is very diverse. Slapping down money on the game can be a nice little luxury but is not required it is entirely just for your own pleasure.[Consistency] The game dose a good job making it easy when you start off but then progresses to become a bit more difficult. If you don't like a game that can get difficult then you need to go back to Wizzard 101 with the rest of the babies."
Good MMO with lots of intereasting systems and classes to play with. A lot of undeserved negative reviews for QOL aspects as opposed to gameplay.Game does however have lag and ping issues but only to a small degree. Hoping it wil be fixed once my server is in its proper place (SEA)
"I have only played this game for about a day - there is server maintenance right now or I would still be playing, it is pretty fun.Keep in mind, as I stated above, I haven't put much time in this game yet I just got it, so read accordingly.8 hour playtime opinion of the game:NOONE talks - I haven't gotten ONE person to take 5 seconds to answer a question with a yes or no. Prepare to google a lot if you have any questions about anything while playing.Some of the quest objectives/locations are rather vague. I spent half an hour finding the crystal cave for a noob archer quest, the quest gave no indication where said cave was, I had to end up googling it to find where it was on the map.Seems laggy at times, but that very well may be me, my internet is poops.I do like the graphics/animation styles. It does feel similar to RO in that regard.I do like being able to TP right back to quest givers when quest is completed.Leveling is pretty easy, i hardly tried and I am around lvl 25, the prison dungeon I am in right now is the first time ive had to use any health pots, but its been pretty funOverall the game is fun, if you read everyones reviews and play it for what it is. It could use a few people who actually talk and are social at times though. It feels like everyone keeps to themselves, and so far I havent seen anything that promotes grouping, maybe that will come later."
"This game is very fun, awesome music, lots of character classes for you to choose from and mix them together, i just love to see how much people can do with this game's possibilities, there are over 800 different builds you can go for... wow.The one thing i dont like are the bots, but just like every mmorpg out there, it needs to have bots XD, at least you can report them in game faster and easy, only this month more than 1000 bot accounts were banned, and this is a good thing"
"Felt really grindy, the missions gets awfully boring at a point and it just felt really mundane due to its repetitive nature. Its hard to meet new people which really cuts the socializing aspect in this game. Monster spawn rate are worst and small number of channels. Had fun for a few hours then it just go downhill for me. Just my 2cents though."
Game is great. It does lack a few contents though. At the very least IMC staff is listening to the community and is doing their best to deliver quality service. I still do hope that they fix the FPS issue being inconsistent soon.
"Product received for freeI don't know why this game has such mixed reviews. If you like action-based MMOs, I highly recommend for you to at least try this someday, since it is free now.I have only played one day, on the day of release so far. I've played both keyboard and gamepad mode and both were smooth once you get used to it. I loved how they used the similar gamepad hotkey key-mapping and UI as FFXIV.The combat system is really fun to me, it is similar to games like Lunia maybe. It feels kind of like a fusion of Ragnarok Online 1 and Lunia. It's action-based and you can attack while jumping. As a wizard, you can jump, then immediately press attack as you start the jump, and keep repeating this to keep yourself 100% mobile while attacking. This is great for bosses.Also, I only played a few seconds on a brand new swordsman and noticed their normal attack does splash AOE damage to multiple monsters if they're close enough.---The problems I had, and greatly hope they will improve in the future are:- The restrictive chat system and bot spamming. There is no specific filter/player mute system, so you cannot prevent shouts from appearing in most chat tabs... and the chat history keeps jumping and not scrolling properly from all the bot spam... so you cannot really read what your party/friend is saying.There was a bot in town in the very center, spamming a tower of chat, and you could not see anything behind them. This was very confusing as a newbie, and all I could do was use the ""Report"" button, but that wouldn't really solve anything if a GM isn't on to kick them right away, unless you're gonna wait however-many days in that spot. I'd much prefer a blacklist/mute option.Also, you cannot say some words which are not particularly bad-words for a T-rated game, such as ""yaoi"".- With a gamepad, I could not find any way to switch around the key mapping, only for keyboard keys. So, this means you must use the ""X"" button on an Xbox 360 controller, to attack. That can be confusing for people who are used to using A or B in other games.- KSing in areas with few channels. the party system is great though, so send invites to others in your area to work together and share quests. I think this isn't a fault of the management, but just the amount of players from the game just opening for free on the first day. It will calm down later for sure.---Overall, I think the good things outshine all of the bad things, except the chat system, since this hinders socializing, which is important to me in online multiplayer games."
"Cant recommend this game. It has some ressemblance of Ragnarok and that why i got interested in playing it but this game has MAJOR technical problemas. And by technical problems i dont say just the lag servers that will probably get fixed soon, i mean the class system seems insteresting but in the end its unrewarding and unfun. The game has its up sides too like boss battles while leveling but its not enough to make the game fun."
"I was all hyped for the Fletcher class. When I finally got the class, I did not realize the server lags, or maybe the skill lags prevented me from using my skills most of the time. So Here I finally got to the class I grinded for, I can't even use the skills since the bugs were never fixed. I played CBT 2, it was fun, but not all market BS and NO TRADE? WTF is a MMO without trade?"
Buggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes but honestly the game's charm helps to overcome most of the issues. The game is great and something I would recommend to most people. The game caters to a certain group of people and if you don't enjoy grindy Korean games then you probably won't enjoy this. Great game to play if you've ever enjoyed maplestory or some other super grindy Korean MMO.
"A fun game with a lot of potential, but also a lot of issues at the moment.  Fortunately, the dev team is working hard to address the problems, and has been responsive to the playerbase, so things are moving in a good direction.  Highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoyed RO.  The game offers lots of classes, and many possible combinations, making character creation interesting and varied.  If you don't mind dealing with some growing pains, then check it out for free.  It's also possible to use in-game money to reach premium-account status, meaning you could theoretically enjoy this game as if you were a paid user without ever spending real money."
Product received for freeThis game has a distinct style of art.  There is a wide variety of characters to play in it.  It seems to be a very busy game at the moment.  I hope it continues
"..a while ago spamming bots and money sellers has been disappeared due to restriction to enter SEA Telsiai serveri enjoyed this game with nice clean communityNOWu let spamming bots and money sellers valid again, nice matchmaking system that make u wait for hours or a half or lifetime to enter, why won't u fix the system and even make a plan to deal with bots/illegal money sellers that ♥♥♥♥ing spam = ♥♥♥♥ing lag ♥♥♥♥ing ruined ♥♥♥♥ u la!"
"Product received for freeSeems like a great game.But there is a control bug. My char keeps running upwards, when press the down key, it stops running. After that always pressing the down key, I can play the game with mouse.I have not seen any bug like this before. As I can not play the game in normal way, I vote NO, until I resolve this issue. I digged forums of the game and internet but could not find a solution."
"Owner is too greedy, devs are clueless, staff is incompetent (because of the owner).It looks like a good game, and it is a good game just before you start noticing how bad it is managed and the potential lost on it.It may become good miraculously in the future, but I doubt it will. They already have a solid userbase to milk money from, and it seems like they are ok to keep the game as it is."
"This game is not perfect but I highly recommend it. Pros:-Art style.-Music.-Class diversity.-Map exploration.-Quest are not marked in map so you need to look for them instead of just follow the main quest.-Costumes.Cons:-Characters needs to be pre-planned, spontaneous characters usually are messed up. -Classes are unbalance in pvp, there are some classes that works great in pvp while other sucks on it.-Players need to make a leveling plan if they want to level up together since their is an exp penalization when the difference between players is higher to 10 lvls. -Dungeons are way too easy (TOO EASY) at the beggining, at high lvl they become harder so it is better."
"You see, this is a game with many many frusturating problems if you want to play it for a long time. However, it's still worth playing for a while and exploring the world. This game has many unique and fun things for all gamers who likes these types of games should explore and experience. Really fun music and interesting art together with deep and interesting class and character optimization. Many interesting and beautiful places to explore. I find the story and events interesting aswell. Combat is rather satisfying aswell. It is a free game so surely many people can enjoy this game before the frusturation of things come after starts overwhelming people or maybe you end up staying. After all there is no perfect mmorpg. I don't think this game is worth staying for the long run yet there are alot of beautiful things to explore so I really recommend checking this game out. It's free after all. I had really great time playing this game till I quit, I think majority of the people feel this way about this game because the unusual frusturations that this game got eventually overwhelm the players. But pay no heed and go ahead and try it. I'm sure you will have fun with it for a good while. It has some unmatched qualities compared to other mmorpgs."
"For me, I really like this game, can explore the mystery. Its a good game! but not suitable for those kiddo. This game look simple, but when come to  inside the game, job builds, status build. Are very challenging and need to adjust or fine tune for ur characters. Our characters builld is like tuning your own car, your remix music. Really not recommend for Kiddo. If not it will end up many negative comment from Kiddo. Enjoy."
I attempted to download the game and it did but when i clicked to open the game in told me file-something not found and then preceeded to leave me on the launcher screen and now everytime i attempt to launch it it simpls stays at the launch screen and from steam it tells me missing file privilege for (file name) please help.
"As of April 6 2016There haven't been a review for 3 days and most are negatives.With the recent patch (April 5), the negative reviews might be reduced. As of now the bots have been addressed at the moment with a lvl 40 minimum requirement for shouting and some bugs taken care of.I would like to recommend this game due to the following:-Active Staff support They literally ask and hear complaints of the players in the forums and ingame.-Good artstyle and musicNostalgic experience, that feeling of the past are returning and somehow getting quite lively again.-Diverse class systemThere are about a total of 80 jobs class to choose from, you can choose your own build.And I would point out the negative things- Linear progression and Grind orientedAlthough grinding starts about lvl 100s but there are some exp curves in some stages of the game that you need to grind or do more side quests-Player trading needs tokenYou need to pay inorder to trade but I think they would change it by the near future or so "
"Fun game and cute graphics. Satisfying mob explosion. Interesting storyline. Long term game play, which isn't suited for players who want instant rewards without putting in the effort."
"Product received for freeThis game was ok at first, I liked it to be honest. But after a while it gets really dull. And it takes forever to grind. Plus the story is really pointless since there are moments where you really have to level up so you can fight quest bosses and win. All in all the game doesn't live up to the hype."
"Alright I'll be very brief and frank here (and fair as much as possible)The game is great, amazingly well made maps and art is one of the pillars of this game for me. The environment totally immerses you into the game. The music, the design, the gameplay all flow very well to draw you into the MMORPG world and never look back. If you appreciate a well designed world for exploration and role playing, this is the game for you.However, the issues people have with this game are almost all on SERVER/DEVELOPER SIDE. It feels like a half-baked cake. This is probably not for you if you're into the competitive scene or the hardcore pvp/skill and reflex thrill seeker.Overall, the game can be experienced at a leisurely pace while rewards those who dedicate time and effort as well. But unfortunately, it falls short on the technical performance side. The gameplay is great but we can't fully appreciate it with FPS and server issues. I'd like to compare it to a good book which can be taken slowly and properly savored with each chapter but a bad movie with messy and confusing action scenes.It's free, give it a go. If you like what you see then continue playing at your own pace, but if you're the type of person who wants to invest a ton of resources to the game, then there are probably better options for you."
Product received for freeI played a couple of hours and the game does have the Ragnarok vibe. IMC should open a new P2P server. The SEA servers are filled to capacity. I won't mind paying a fee just to play with fewer people and no bots. C'mon IMC you want my money? Open a new P2P server!!!
"Worst support ever.Bought the early access for the goodies and it's lagged as hell.They don't answer tickets, fix the server issues, get rid of the bots and everything else.Seems like they hosted the server on the AWS Trashcan with a 56k modem and a Pentium 100.Moving to another game because, 3 days trying to play with long queues, isn't worth a single penny I spent in this game."
"Pros: This game has achievements that translate to reward, kill enough monsters get a reward, do enough quests get a reward, and they are things like extra silver, experience and fun items, This rewards you for just playing the game and relaxing its quite a fun bit. Leveling is fast and not overly slow, and picking your classes should be slow and methodical because picking them can change your character quite radically. Lots of options to choose from and customization. There is ample crafting in the game, and a rather unique guild system. The art, graphics, storylines and music are all absolutely stunning as well. It's not pay2win, anyone can earn a token relatively easily at the high levels.Cons: The company seems to make some poor decisions at times, which is understandable I suppose. Some downtime is expected and the release date for free2play was pushed back because during an update they had some bugs, it shows that while the company cares, they don't have the skills or management to keep downtime to a minimum which can be frustrating.  They've also compensated the players well for this downtime though, so its a bit off a trade off. Lastly for cons and this is the most important thing, the game can be tough for someone who doesn't look into classes and ranks, and doesn't optimize their character at the high levels.TL:DR Games good, companys meh, careful which ranks/classes you choose.8/10"
"Playing this with a group of friends and it's pretty fun so far.This game has many potentials as it's a unique kind of mmorpg game I've seen.Sudden fps drops and cannot-talk-to-npc situations may occur sometimes, but still playable.Not bad, hoping for many improvements in this game in the near future."
"As of writing this I have 225 Templar with a guild.It's kinda fun to play if you are a mmo fan since way before time. You'll find yourself levelling up a character and might spent a lot of hours while doing so. It' has this enjoyable little flashback feeling to old school 2d mmo's just as Ragnarok Online.. and that's about it. Everything else in this game is done badly, wrong, stupidly or just plain idiotic. I'm not going to list all the problems since everyone writing a review has already done so and you can check those out if you want.I will not recommend this game to anyone UNLESS you really are after:a) Anime basedb) Old school 2dc) Viewed from aboved) Free to playe) MMO"
"After spending 200+ Hours, enduring many problem and pain.I come up with this new review to give em a 'POSITIVE'Overview****************************************************************Before playing TOS make sure you understand these facts :'There's nothing free in this world, everything come with a prize'and'Developer need money to run their company, and buy stuff & food to support their life.They can't just standing under sun light and survived only by the heat.'Yes this game is not really 'FREE', you may free to try, free to play but with limitation, a lot of limitation to the point that I'm wondering:'Why IMC Game didn't just made it subscribe pay?' (In my own opinion the problem cause by over populace in one server might disappear, and bot banning be more effective because bot too need to pay and get perma banned!.)The Good****************************************************************- Graphic and Visual Effect.- Casual Mix in RPG, Quest & Grinding together.- Not that extremely hard rare drop rate, unlike other MMO I've play so far since 2000.- Not too hard boss fight, but required some brain. (When you get used to it, it become more boring sometime.)The Bad****************************************************************- IMC Game never really give you a respond in forum but they were listen.- Bad Service & Support.- IMC Game decision about operating or change in the game were base on prophecy than fact, they even didn't know that when they open the server to Free2Play, it'll over crowd and made everything broken. (Why they have close and open BETA?)- So many bug in higher level game, lacking in testing progress. (Imagine, instead of IMC Game created test group for that, they just simply let the BETA tester grinding hard for 300 Hours to reach that point.)- IMC Game too non professional as publisher. (They are developers.)Final Thought****************************************************************I'd recommend you to play it, if you're planning on spending money for IMC Game. Buying their 'Token' and made your life in this game not miserable."
"(I'm going to be serious on this review)I've been playing TOS for a long time. The environment is very aesthetic, nice club music as well as refreshing job system. But if you want to play this game, keep in mind that:-You will engage  immense level and money grinding. You can do it solo, but if you're a tank built..It'll take a while. Moral Lesson: Use your cards wisely.-Marketplace is pretty broken; there are a bunch of over-inflated items that isn't even worth the price.-Bots and spammers all over Klaipeda as well as dungeons, which can be really annoying since they tend to steal your kills.-Collision bugs, a nuisance when riding the elevator because you fall off.-Lag; which bring us to:-Frequent rubberbanding; really annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥specially when fighting a boss because sometime the camera flies away, making it impossible to see what's going on.The game is fun, but  I would not recommend it-- Specially on its current state. I'm sure they're trying their best to fix these errors, but they should have tried resolving problems before they even release the game as a f2p. Play with caution."
"Hmm lots of complainers like literally i like the game personally some people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about paying at least $10 for this game and they said they hated it and are ♥♥♥♥♥ing hard how its a waste of money (lol) are you serious its not like the game asked you to pay for it its free to play fer fks sakes why didnt you wait, oh yeah some other stuff people been ♥♥♥♥♥in about this game how this game only lets you trade 1 item until its sold and have to wait two days to get your money and how you have to get a token to list 5 at the same time and so you can trade, first off they made the market like so in an attempt to discourage gold sellers not stop they specifically stated that stop gold sellers is not easy for them and i doubt ot is for any other mmo games out there gold sellers find their ways you cant blame the devs for trying to make the people that use the market hold seller reliable because the market prices suddenly became ridiculously high, and the token seriously its some thing you can get with in hame gold you dont have to buy it from the damn store how many games does that? I got 1 million silver in this game in a week timespan by going to where the world bosses are trying to luck in on recipe's sometimes crafting recipes that will sell and sell it on the market and let me tell you this i didnt have a damn token! But guess what i got over a million gold within a week guess what i can get with 1 m gold if i wanted to 2♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tokens but will i do it fk no it wont do anything but just make me waste my money id rather buy a weapon recipe i can use. Shii...... Anyways i went of topic some where, to summarize my point this game is not necessarily bad because you cant work for something you can earn in the game with an ingame money or because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about bot hackers gold sellers and some other♥♥♥♥♥♥your complaining about, this game didnt force anyone against their will or made them waste money for buying an early acess and complaining about it because theyre being a little ♥♥♥♥♥ its your fault for buying an early access on a game that is going to be free to play and its also your fault because you didnt research the game thoroughly and wait for feed backs and for those who havent tried this game yet try it for yourself and you should decide instead of relying on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s reviews :)"
"After about half year i left this game, i came back and its still can be called Tree of Lag, Tree of Bots.. Not much improvement and active player are decreasing.. Wont hurt to try tho..."
"This is a ""Okay"" game.Read some of the review i think overall this game is OVERRATED.why ?-This game giv me a feeling that its unprepared to let player play.-Too many bugs (although it can be easily fix my relog / switch channel)-Too many graphic glitch-Poor performance optimization "
"If you are seeking for MMORPG which can enjoy with friends. This is not the one you are looking for. The game forbid every charactor interation even within the same account.Also, don't even bother with support team. There is NONE.have fun."
If you're looking for a game with full of server lags and delaysyou're are welcome to try it out =D IP blocks for pinoys and other country has bypass and joined the servercausing it to lag beyond anything i seen. Thanks Peenoise! You ruined Dota 2 and now you get to ruin Tree of Savior.
"I feel like my review will be more helpful to those who just now want to start the game, so I have no say on end-game content but this is what I'm experiencing with the game right now:First biggest complaint is the mouse controls. This game offers keyboard, controller, or mouse gameplay and the mouse is wonky. It really shouldn't be an option as there are many issues with walking on certain maps. The second would be not getting a reward after turning in a quest. After doing multiple quests with my friends and boyfriend, I was the only one who didn't receive my reward and that was it. The quest acted as if I turned it in, so I know I didn't just ""abandon"" it, and I was able to move onto the other ones WITHOUT a reward. Yeah pretty obnoxious. Lag lag lag lag lag. My god is the lag in this game unreal. I have played plenty of MMO's, and I've never experienced lag like this game provides. Which leads to positioning lag. Basically your character is in the middle of the map, then BAM you're back at the beginning. Absolutely infuriating to deal with. I guess this is supposed to be a grinding game similar to RO, but good luck finding a map with any monsters on it. Some areas are completely void of any monsters whatsoever, and it's even worse when there's a quest circle above said area. And if you DO find a great spot, enjoy battling the multiple bots on the map who will just KS your mob and you'll lose everything to them cause they're always 30+ levels above and mob drops/exp are based on who did the most damage. And you may think ""oh I'll just change channels!"", nope won't work because there will be bots on that channel too. Plus as the maps get harder with higher lvl monsters, there's less and less channels to change to. For some reason, IMC decided that restricting trades and the marketboard would get rid of the bots but it only hurt actual players; unless you pay for a token to trade 30 times a month. It's just crazy because this is an MMO, what MMO doesn't allow trading between players for multiple days unless you buy a token? Apparently this one. We shouldn't have to pay for BASIC functions of a game, that is crazy. I'm just annoyed and sad because as someone who played RO for many years, I was hoping this would finally be the MMO to replace it, but thanks to Nexon's sister company IMC, this game is already falling apart due to their carelessness and restrictions that ONLY hurt actual players and not the bots/gold bots."
"I wanted to love this game but...I'll start with some developmental flaws: the performance is unreliable/buggy even on an overpowered PC - it is not optimized. Lots of 'rubber banding', frame rate drops and mysterious lag as well. The controls are shoddy, especially when trying to execute a directional move. This game has been in development for over a year now, there is little reason it should not at least be optimized. That being said, most of the flaws I will further point out are not developmental ones, but design flaws.The economy. There are instrinsic mechanics set in place to devalue items, thus eventually rendering them useless. Trading between players requires a token. Tokens are purchased with real cash. This can be circumvented by buying one off the market, but the economy makes this difficult since prices keep climbing as silver-farming zones become more congested. You are restricted to selling one item at a time, unless you have a token. I would describe the real money transaction system is 'pay to make it bearable'.Swarming with bots: This contributes to the poor economic conditions of the game, and high prices on the market attract a lot of RMT activity. This cyclical problem is represented well here. These bots will also be competing with you for farming items and money as they are seemingly an integral and permanent obstacle of the game.There is a VERY restrictive cap on the amount of dungeons you can run for loot and experience. 3 mission dungeons + 3 loot dungeons (if you purchase a token, otherwise this total is 4) per day leaves you with little to do aside from grinding. There is not much raiding going on here. The community. The game does not incentivize teamwork. Most things can be done solo, aside from running a few instances a day with strangers. The field bosses are on static timers, and thus are 'poop-socked' by the grand-fathered few. The lack of a socially dependent community results in lots of name calling, greifing, and general unhelpfulness. Asking questions will typically incite a response with the maturity level of a 'Your Mom' type insult or a snarky antisocial retort. New players are looked down upon -  This is just the norm here. Perhaps all the flaws in the game leave the community feeling bereft, and they take their toxicity out on one another. I put over 200 hours into this game, as well as founding donation cash, believing that it would improve, but it seems that the aforementioned issues continue to spiral downward and compound one another. I really wanted this game to succeed. In my experiences as an MMO player, poor communities and economies stem from bad game mechanics, pay-walls, unchecked exploitation and a pure lack of moderation. This game is a hot, steaming pile of everything that can possibly go wrong in an MMO and a sad dissapointment. Aspiring game developers should use this as a template of what not to do.It is easy to fall into a habit of complacency when tolerating a game's broken issues in the hopes that things will progress. However, do not fall into this phsychological pattern and squander your finite time on this planet over this game. It is just not worth it. There are many great, finished products out there that can offer what this game falls short on.My advice: find a stable, subscription based MMO with a helpful community and active GMs."
Well i like it.. nice rpg game...What i like the most is the soundtrack@background music..Pretty sure i can sit for hours in there with such a good melody..Sound 10/10 I recommend it..its free by the way..
"Game's starting to get better now as the developers and the community managers are back with how responsive they were to the game's problems. Be it RMT, bugs, glitches and/or gameplay balance issues.Just trust the positive reviews and play this MMO with friends."
" I've recently returned to this game and it has improved a -lot- since it opened and is so much more playable. This game has beautiful art and graphics and a unique class/job system that sets it apart from  other MMOs. I started playing this game during early access, when it had -so- many bugs at launch and was experiencing some serious issues that I just had to quit playing for a while. I recently decided to return and see if it had improved or not and it most definetely has."
"The lag that still exists in this game makes it very difficult to play. I haven't been able to get very far because of that. I really wanted to, since it looked very pretty, and the sounds were fairly nice. In my attempts to stutter through the beauty, I also noticed that there weren't very many others around. I had been bombarded with bot sellers when the game first came out, but quickly turned chat off. So I don't know if that was fixed, as I left it off on later logins. There's also some info as to this being a p2w game, but I wasn't able to get into it enough to figure that out. My 5 hours or so was spent lagging my way to level 28, or something close to that. Anyway, I can't recommend it. I logged in today and the lag is just as bad for me when the game first came out. I have no issues with any other game (new or old), or my internet. There's just something still not right with this game. I'm really glad I didn't spend any money on it."
"Tree of Savior is a great game but sadly IMC tried to to get their greedy hands on players money ruining way too fast a game that could last for years and with higher profits. Trying all kinda of tricks like offering useless items in a bundle with some tp barelly enough to get a decent item from shop, making you invest another 10â‚¬ to buy a item that last only 1 month, its kinda sad to see that people from Lituania (Where the game got inspiration for city names, goddess and lore) need to work for 5 days to be able to afford 1 token!I love this game and i would love to be able to play this ""Free"" game, i just hope IMC kill this servers as fast as possible to see if any other company can pick up this game and actually make it playable"
"Product received for freeSo I spent some time in this game and I'm gonna be taking a break until a couple of patches after hitting Hunter.I'll just be quick about it since there's plenty of other reviews talking in detail about this game:Pros+Good art style, enemies look interesting+Music is catchy and loops are generally long+Interesting class decisions (Sadhu, Linker, Thaumaturge, etc)Cons- Enemy models are re-used often- Music and audio bug out randomly- ""Interesting"" classes but stale ""meta"" builds most commonI played ToS and had been waiting for it to come out, but upon release I'm fairly disappointed. The base classes feel weak, auto attacks are VERY important to all classes DPS (just give us something more interesting to do!), attacks and spells are unresponsive and randomly fail. But I think okay, I'll give it a chance - level an Archer to Hunter.My Companion AI attempting to autoattack can animation cancel Coursing or Rush Dog, putting the ability on CD and using the SP but doing no damage and having no effect. And not ""every once in awhile"", but due to the awful AI of the companion anyway he'll pretty regularly decide to input a move command or something after you use an ability and nothing happens.I could deal with the game if it was just ""some of the classes aren't that strong"" or ""the game is really grindy"" or ""there's a lot of bots"" but ""this class feels bad to play because the abilities randomly fail"" shouldn't be a problem for a game that had any sort of beta testing."
"I think it's safe to say that I've invested a fair amount of time in this game, so here's my advice: Don't Play IT!!!- the only feature this game gives you is to kill monsters over and over again till you get sick of it- there's absolutely nothing you can do if you want to have a change of pace from all the killing aside from logging off"
"Epic game. Still need some updates and patches but it's obvious that the game isn't in it's final release form.Nostalgic but definetely not the same type of game of Ragnarok, don't fool yourselves."
"Excellent game regardless of the low population. Everything in this Game brings out the Old School RPG kid in me, the feeling of how they used to be just fades away when playing Tree of Savior. There are a few minor issues but easily overlooked when you're playing the Game for what it is and not for what it could've been.Maybe a year or so more Devs, keep it up and this might just be one of the best games yet."
"Farmed for desert fox ears for 5-6 hours straight. Got 2. 1 for me, one for my friend.Farmed goggles, Farmed flower hairpin. 7-8 hours total.Was waiting for trade system so I could  trade it to my friend and trade it back to my new character.Just to find out the items becomes untradable.IMC What in the ♥♥♥♥ man. I really dig this ♥♥♥♥ing game but stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like this makes the gameSO. ♥♥♥♥ING. STUPID. GIVE. ME. MY. TIME. BACK."
"When you first start playing this game, it seems to be really fun. You think, why are there mixed reviews on Steam? If you keep playing for a few hours after that, you start to understand.I would make a pros and cons list, but I can't actually think of that many pros. For what it is, it's a really fun game that you can grind for hours (if you're into that kind of game). The cons seem to far outweigh the pros, though.Cons:""Press Z to win"" - This is a problem that a lot of people have, but I never found to be a huge concern since the main class I chose was the wizard. The general majority of classes level up strength religiously due to the constant need to basic attack. Some people complain that the lack of spell-combos and reliance on basic attacks leads to a boring game experience, which I feel is completely valid.The next three are general restrictions in Tree of Savior and my main reasons for not recommending it.""Free"" Game - The game in itself is free to play, and there's no absolute need to buy in-game currency. However, leading into the next point, it seems like it would be very difficult to play this way.Punishing creativity/new players - I'll admit, when I started playing this game I didn't look at any guides at first and that may have been rather foolish, as I leveled up many wrong things along the way. Come to find out, there is no way to reset your skills for free with leveling up, like other mmo's, instead you have to exchange real currency (about 6 USD) to do so. This makes no sense, and couples with a few other restrictions (coming up next) that make me unable to recommend the game.The ""Marketplace"" - I don't think I have ever seen a trade system as broken as this one in an mmo. I was relatively excited to learn that the game had this feature, since I had used it heftily on other games, only to find out that there are huge drawbacks that go along with this. The first time you are able to use this system is when you arrive in the first city, but upon further inspection you cannot list any items for sale until (two or three, I can't recall) days after your character is made. This seems alright, a relatively effective approach at postponing any trade scandals that allegedly plagued this game, but then it gets worse. Without a token (bought either using massive amounts of silver, or with real life currency exchange, amounting to 12-13 USD) you can only list one item at a time for sale. This makes listing materials or equipment wildly impractical, as selling 5 things could take you literally 5 days. Of course, they take even this a few steps further. You cannot list anything for more than a maximum price given, or lower than a minimum price given - and it must be rounded (cannot list something for 4536, you would have to list it for 4600). This means that competitive pricing is nonexistent for a lot of the earlier items, so listing materials and equipment is essentially a crapshoot, hoping your item is chosen among dozens of others listed at the same price. It doesn't stop here, though - along with a 1% listing fee (reasonable), if and when the item sells there is a 30% service charge on the total price of the item. As if only getting 69% of the intended selling price for an item isn't a big enough kick in the balls, you also have to wait an additional 48 hours after the item sells to be able to receive the silver for it. This is one of the most broken and dysfunctional marketplace systems I have ever personally -tried- to use.*This doesn't really go with marketplace, but I figured I'd add it somewhere. You cannot transfer items between characters (you have four initial character slots when creating your account), nor can you trade with other players without having a token. Even with a token, you are limited to making 30 player trades per month.Marketplace tl;dr: Restricts to the point of almost unusability.Aside from the restrictions and debatably boring gameplay, I enjoy this game. There are other complications that I have had, like FPS issues and my character not turning precisely when I want him to in order to land a skillshot, but ultimately those are due to my computer being -less than great- and weren't factored into my recommendation. It makes me sad to see the game ruined (for me) by restrictions placed on gameplay because of problems in the past. Tree of Savior has a lot of the fun elements seen in other mmos, and a lot of ones that were new to me and perhaps unique to the game, but overall I can't recommend this game in its current state.Edits: Changed wording on a couple of things, added tl;dr, fixed previous statement that you pay a 10% listing fee, this was intended to be 1%."
"Actually it is a really good game but there are too many people complaining this game... come on guys its just only beta test for now. Why expect so much? If you really can't stand now, then play the game when the SEA server is release...Very nice game with various classes.Good gaming style, (especially for keyboard players <3)epic music and graphicVarious bosses and dungeons."
"Why dont you put a restriction on each founder pack bought for each account, for example if an account already bought 1 pack he/she cant buy anymore if someone buy them for a gift the account cant receive the product because of the restriction of the founders pack be bought by one account thats simple put a restriction on account of the amount of founders pack be bought plus your moving the date of your F2P release for what to gain more money from playes to play??? think before you act you should known already that you package can be bought several times its not an excuse to remove the 3pack and move the date of F2p.....this is my concern of the game hope you understand me and the other ppl hope you resolve your problems....."
"A great game especially for those who played Ragnarok Online, like MMOs and Isometric games. Needs polishing, but you can have fun enough already, with much content .Pros- Unique Class System with thousands of possibilities- Great Graphics - Thousands of maps, quests, and bosses- Many secrets about the class mechanics and the game that were not discovered until today- Various classes with crafting- Good soundtrack- Very good to play both the mouse or the keyboard and especially in console joystickCons- Some major interface problems, like, world map is terrible, and another things...- Probably the biggest problem of all . Very poorly optimized.- Some lag issues with the server, but I believe this is temporary , because the game has just opened F2P- The game is Korean, yes, it was racist, but you know what I'm talking about.- Leveling is easy once you understand how to play (until lvl 200), but it is not intuitive and it is not clear at any time you have to do the quests in the two capitals for example."
"Game is freaking awesome. This is the real RO2, exept it's a whole new setting. Do take note that a MMO launch is never smooth, so be prepared to wait a bit, lagg a bit and crash a bit."
"Product received for freeThis game is amazing :D you meet alot of people and party with them which is kinda cool.all in all, this game is recommended for those who want adventure and RPG"
"Excelente jogo. Péssima administração. Servidores lagados, canais travados, personagens presos no limbo. Zero pronunciamento da staff.Excellent game. Bad administration. Lagged servers, locked channels, characters stuck in limbo. Zero staff pronouncement."
"I absolutely love this game.  I play it with a friend and with just two people it's great.  Whether alone or with a party, questing is a piece of cake!  People that have played for only an hour or two have written horrible reviews, but keep in mind this is a brand new game.  They are still working out some kinks, but they quickly handle each and every issue that comes up.  By the time the F2P comes out in mid-may, it should be great!  If you loved RO, you'll love this.  I highly recommend!"
"Product received for freeLove the graphic style of the game, the multiple amounts of job classes that is offered. The interface is easy to use and control. Grinding for collectables can be a hassle especially for super rare drops. The BUFFS that you buy in CH 1 from other players show up to last 2 hours but dont truly last that duration which is unfortuante. Lot of quests and things to do in game as well as alternative ways to make in game currency and income.  Overall I like the game thus far but could use some changes and tweeks imho."
"BAD BAD BAD BAD....................... EU servers,they are just across atlantic ocean,are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?EU servers mid earth far aways? You dont do anything?EU servers are US servers WTF,lag lag lag lag lag and laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag,are you kidding us IMC? You think we ll gonna pay some bundle you just added in shop,go creat an EU server and we ll see if we ll pay for that but for a laggy game like that pvp is impossible and pve is just random cause you dont know if you gonna skill,so maybe,maybe my Heal gonna work,maybe i m walking and dodging,who know?New EU are in germany but same♥♥♥♥♥♥worst server ever PVE random,PvP total s  h  i  t  cause delay and freeze ,don t play this if you need europe servers"
"This is my review from playing this game for 180hrs, and progressing very very slowly (doing most quests, exploring to the best of my abilities).I'm going to start this by saying this game has huge potential, some very awful CONS that get overshadowed by a very nice    mmorpg experience.So to get the CONS out of the way, my main complaints are:- Very restricted trade system.- 48hr wait to cash in on your sales from the Market.- A very loud minority of crybabies and trolls that like to hate on BRs and IMC.- FPS drops when a lot of players are gathered in the same area. This makes massive PvP unplayable even on high end PCs. Optimization issues? don't know.So to start on why this game is awesome. First off the graphics are something very very unique. Character models, game envyroments, animations, atention to detail, mobs, etc are an absolute masterpiece, same with the artwork. The story is very broad, though it lacks a bit of depth (incomplete story that will get expanded later on). Questing feels great, fighting mobs is quite fullfilling, The sense of progression is there, and the stuff to do is quite endless at every level range (Dungeons, missions, daily quests, crafting, farming, exploring, collections, etc).So far I'm loving my character and all I've done in game. Definetly an mmo worth a shot."
"Very nice game! At the first sight I couldn't imagine that I might have fun with a game looking like that, but since I missed healing in recent games, i gave it a shot.... and I'm still totally happy with this game!"
"Product received for freeDo not play this game. It is a lag fest with tons of bugs (one is that you get back to the server selection after you choose your character) and even tho its 2016, there are MANY bots spamming in cities without control (you can't even mute them).If you wanna enjoy a game, go play something else."
" Fun game if you have friends to play with. Token for premium is dirt cheap , you can basically play for free ( farming the silver for it takes one day max(around 2h)) complex class design - nearly every build has its purpose terrible engine slow updatesinsane amount of bugsdevelopers don't seem to care for the international versiontoxic communitytoxic communitytoxic communitytoxic communitytoxic communitytoxic community "
"The game is gorgeous, but the servers are the worst I have ever seen in my entire life, and I've played a LOT of MMORPGs. The lag is unbelievably bad, you get rubber band lag every 1 to 3 seconds in its current condition. There are bots everywhere and the economy is already on its way to the crapper, making it impossible soon for new players to have a chance at getting anything from the market store.  Which brings me to the next defect. To stop gold sellers and bots, the developers are emplyoing ridiculously strict policies which could be handled in different ways AND as they are, they're not helping much anyway. Being unable to trade unless you pay for it with real money is, to put it simply, bad marketing. IF you DO pay for a token (this is the premium 30 day membership), you may trade 5 times a day only, you can also keep items in the market for 7 days (with a fee, of course), and you have to wait 48 hours, that's right - two whole days - to retrieve your money from the market. I'm not sure if this has changed either, but as far as I know you won't be able to trade with players who have no token, which is just silly.I give this game 2 stars out of 10 only because it's beautiful, but what's the point of having such an artistic game when it's impossilbe and unbearable to play it at the moment. I'll get back and update once everything is fixed, but the way things are going, it's easy to predict that it will get a whole lot worse first, especially with the coming F2P opening. My advice is to AVOID AT ALL COST FOR NOW!"
"(Original review in first year of launch)It's going to be F2P soon.Play it. Disregard reviews, make your own mind up.For myself, it's brought back the nostalgia of Ragnarok and the team at IMC seem to be REALLY listening to the playerbase, making endless changes based on feedback. This is only a good thing.Even right now, prerelease, it's fun, balanced and very playable, with good end game content.Recommend strongly that people give it a go before disregarding based on reviews. It may capture your imagination, it may not, but you won't know from reading so many trolly reviews.EDIT(2016):The alternative version of this review is:""I played this game for 600 hours. Wah. 2/10""Don't listen to the whiney troll reviews. If they got 600 hours out of the game they got tremendous value from their purchase. Could have stopped playing after just a few hours couldn't they?EDIT2 (Feb 2018):I can no longer truly vouch for ToS anymore as I haven't played it in a while, but I will say that while I have moved on to FF the game holds a very fond place in my heart. While it had its issues, it also had its fantastic aspects.I would recommend it for story and for a casual bit of monster killing roleplay fun. But as the playerbase has heavily dwindled I could no longer recommend it as an mmo. The class system is one of the most customisable and imaginative systems ever created, and if you want to make a character with a specific roleplay idea in mind, you can.I am grateful to it for the hundreds of friends it helped me make, who I am still close to today."
"As everyone has said, game needs work. Devs need to react to this or the game will die off. They may not care, who knows? Don't waste your time and money till the devs show some love for the game."
Ok let me start by saying i really enjoy this game.  It has a FF Tactics art style and some unique elements and an overwhelming amount of classes But it needs some serious fixing too allow me to elaborate.1. Want to use shared storage? costs 10$ and only lasts 30 days.2. Want to use the auction house? It says requires level 40. Got to 40 says must play for a week to use it lololol!3. Outfits that used to sell for TP have doubled in price and been moved to a gacha as a cash grab.4. Everything in this game is ultra restrictive even if you spend money. There is 0 room for error on charcter build or your basically useless and need to start over.5. Game gives no direction and a guide is essential.Overall just play for fun and you will most likely quit in a month or 2. It's f2p give a try and see for yourself.
"Despite all the negativity and bad reviews I decided to give this game a try. I've been casually playing this for a few weeks now and it is alright for what it is. Surely ToS has its issues but then again, what game is truly perfect in all aspects? There are some bugs here and there that can be annoying but other than that I am having a blast exploring the beautiful word or simply trying out new classes with different builds.The good thing for me is this game isn't pay to win at all. You can pay for some convenience or cosmetics at best, those are easily farmable with ingame currency though. The same applies for the Token (premium item which grants some quality of life improvements, nothing too harsh), you can easily farm one in two to three days of casual playing.The story is alright for what it is, I have seen worse. Questing can be tiresome and boring at times but oh well, that is to be expected from an korean mmorpg. If you prefer grinding over questing this game will serve you decently well, there are different ways to progress through levels so you can have some diversity on your own while playing at your own pace.Bots and goldsellers exist and may annoy you here and there but then again, those are present in most online games these days. Overall the gameplay is fun, the music is decent and I highly recommend trying this out and get your own opinion."
"Very ambitious game, but they forgot to fill in the blanks. Hundreds of hours of gameplay with close to no gear replacement along the way, and I want to stress that this is an understatement, there is practically a massive desert of gear in this game. Alot of multiplayer only content that no one qeues for that is suppose to be rewarding and isn't, end game content perma camped by whoever has the highest dps (not you). The anti bot measures they took that heavily punished legit players. I invested alot of time into this game, but in the end I really didn't feel that it paid off and that it wasn't worth playing anymore, after so many months and no upgrades to the existing problems, and now over a year later they still havn't made changes at all - I would say stay away from this game, it should have been twice as good from launch. And they've had a long time to fix issues and upgrade their game but they havn't. You'd think they either don't care, or are incompetent."
"I played this game Since its release in April. It has so much problems that rather than fixing it, they would rather add costumes. When this game had so much problems and people recommended solutions, i.e. Excurlon tried developed solutions and other features to lessen the FPS stress and improve an actual working User Interface, IMC does not try to incorporate some of the good ones.The game's drop system, Drop per kill , which can easily be stolen by DPK calculators when they observe your kill rates make it totally unfair. You farm a hard item which takes 2 hours only to be stolen and have to kill again for 2 hours long. They do not factor many things such as Quantity, Difficulty, Volume, fluctuation, spawn time, cooldowns, and many other things into the item to account for it. The only time they will respond immediately to a problem is when someone is abusing the hack to the point that its causing a massive error to other players. Even then, they would not get banned. Video proofs, screen shots, are mostly being ignored. They kept telling players that they will send it to their developers but they will never acknowledge this. They will apply changes behind your back without admitting to it, and even tried to lie about it.They developed a skill for crafting different things but with totally different functionality, some which are absolutely malfunctional. For Example, A Pardoner can Craft 100 straight items by increasing the volume, and per volume increase adds +30 seconds to the timer. On the other hand, crafting potions for an Alchemist takes 20 seconds per 5 Potions, if you increase the volume, it re-casts the next 20 seconds then cuts out due to poor utility of the feature.They are inconsiderate about their players, and others that have left were many more times fortunate than I am. This game is garbage, with bad customer service. You paid for something, and it bugs? You won't get it back. I for one am a victim of this several times (sure what a fool I am).This game is toxic, full of problems, bot problems, hackers that mostly do not get banned because they do not have a way to check on this without relying on players. Game is imbalanced. Story is Badly translated. Game does not properly go with the story other than the beginning of the game. And so On. I swear man, this game makes me wanna punch the developers. Go keep my change,♥♥♥♥♥this game.I would also like to add the fact that they do not test their patches and push them to players, therefore causing more exploits, and directory errors. Rather than listening to players, they're blaming the add ons. I already explained to them some of the cause of errors, and they have yet to do anything about it. Good luck. I tried."
"Ok you can see how long I played the game.The game have ALOT of flaw atm. I will be editing this whenever they going to fix it in 2 months or so. The worst problem right now poor optimization of the game towards high end pc.Wont recommend 11/10 unless you just want to feel the nostalgic of RO. I wont stop you.OK after playing for 3k hours, This game is not going anyway regardless. so yea shu shu dont touch the game"
"I've put a lot of hours into this game. It is a very fun game. However, what leads me to post a very angry review is the lack of respect for the player's wallet. I understand it's an MMO, and this is typically the case. My problem is that you have to purchase Team Storage with real money, and you can't even deposit the other things you bought with real money into the storage. So, now I have a character which I completely ♥♥♥♥ed up (since it was my first character) that has an $18 vanity item I guess I'll never be seeing again. I suppose deleting this character will destroy the item as well. I don't understand why you can't share the purchasable items across your characters. Why do we have such huge consequences for noob mistakes!Also, they need to fix their companions in this game. My dang companion has been rendered practically useless since stamina doesn't replenish on it anymore. So I guess my beast master class is completely ♥♥♥♥ing pointless now. Thanks a lot, imcgames, for ruining my experience and not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥"
"Bad performance, microstutter, awkward system design, toxic implementation of F2P backbone (FYI I love F2P) and another Korean game with no control over illicit activity.There's probably a good game here but it's buried under mismanagement."
Product received for freeNot very enjoyable.Game is enjoyable but terrible server. Not recommended until they fix all the bugs and server issues.Peak hour entrance into the game requires you to que. Imagine what happen if you got disconnected and it makes you wait in an even longer que. Totally annoying.
"Product received for freeBeen looking forward to this for ages, but the games servers are so bad that I can't even play. Will come back to play when it works. As is, I can't reccomend this."
"I can not in full faith recommend this game to anyone. The game has some huge fundamental problems.The game features several different controls depending on how you want to play. It's great that they offer the ability to change on the fly at any point. However, it does come with the problem of things like keyboard prompts appearing while playing with a controller.The gameplay itself is rather bland. It's slightly more active than a typical M-M-O game, but still lacking. The addition of awful server lag every time I played didn't help in this regard. It always felt like too many people were in a channel even if it displayed the capacity as being on the lower end. Sometimes you would also get thrown into the high capacity ones for seemingly no reason. Towns have plenty of silver spammers already. The speech bubbles that appear with their world chat spam will cover the UI / menus and be incredibly fustrating to deal with on the first encounter. Thankfully you can turn these global chat bubbles off and save yourself some pain. HOWEVER, the worst part is that the bubbles will actually LAG your game, and what does disabling them do? Only hides them. YOU WILL STILL LAG. I kid you not.Tree of Savior quickly runs out of quests for it's newbies. Around LVL 30 you'll hit a wall of a lack of quest lines in the starting area of your choice. Now you can go to the other starting area and progress through that one as well, but variety is pretty much non-existant as far as I could tell. The class system is where the meat of the game is. Plenty of options to choose and pick from.The game is free though and worth taking a look if you have the data to spare. Honestly to me it's just another MMORPG to throw in the bucket. I'd recommend Path of Exile if you want deep and complex character builds with RPG elements. It's free to play as well."
"I can really summarize this game in:""Oh, did you use a Teleport Scroll to teleport to the other City? You got a message saying that the Channel is Full? Well, F*CK YOU! You lost your Teleport Scroll and the money you paid for it!""Easily avoided if the system wasn't f*cking stupid and consume your Scroll when you click to use it and start the Teleport Animation instead of when you finish the Teleport Animation and reach the stupid place you want to be. Or at least give the scroll back when the Channel is Full.""The Channel is Full.""I don't know what they have in their heads to think that a game based on Channels for EACH MAP would work, when you're on a random map, you're fine, but when you try to enter a City, you can't because all the stupid Channels of the City is Full.I will not even mention the Lag, the horrible game optimization and the clunky combat system/combat animations, because I will give the benefit of the doubt of the combat being clunky due to the lag.This game has a cool Class System (even if I don't like the restriction of only Templars able to create a Guild, I like more restrictions to create a Guild, but Class Lock isn't one of them, and the fact that the game don't have an Assassin class because of the Lore, everyone is a Savior and an Assassin class wouldn't fit in the lore and yadda yadda) and art, but for now, you really should avoid it."
"Brought the founder pack and reached level 225 doppelsoelder rank 7 within 3 weeks of gameplay and here are the summary of good/bad experience i encounted thus far;Awesome artworkSick BGMLots of Quest to allow you to level you through 1-200 without much monotonous grindingCould potentially be a great game/complete game but it's pretty much unplayable/not worth playing right now less for the daily dungeon rush; hoping to get something good from lootbox(cubes) which pretty much give junk most of the time.Game does not reward effort/time spend in gameTons of classes in the game, however, the viability of these classes are limited because the game is still new and balancing patch has not come in. Most skills of classes do not scale well into higher level.Mobs/dungeons are not challenging in the sense that they only increase in terms of their Hp/dmg(no mechanics involved, think diablo, what makes it worst is that your skill damage doesn't increase poportionately to their Hp forcing party play at higher level, no room for solo players)In-game Avatar looks boring - You will probably look the same as many other playersNo point grinding end game for loot because mobs don't drop anythingGrinding monster for silver is pointless because of the No. of Botters and rate of inflationBots are everywhere(Common in MMO i guess)Auto-find party are buggy Afk-er in party during dungeon runs are allowedCommission in market are 30%, 10% with token(think elite status)1:1 trade Restrictiontakes 48 hours to retrieve money from item you sold on marketServer(Telsiai/Varena) laggy most of the time, 5-30sec delay while interacting with NPC on certain serversPVP unbalanced to a huge extendLimited end game maps, can spot a few parties in the same map trying to grind at the same timeTL;DR pretty much unplayable in the current state, but still fun if you are playing with friends on NON-PEAK HOURS and check out guides online before creating a charactor so that you won't risk rolling a unplayable class at the end"
6 months 1 skill still not fix . that skill is already insignificant ( corsair flag ) when the buff trigger ( combo fever ) it remind you everytime you play that character its bug ..  bug 6 month not fix .. no comment .. no reply from the ticket .. no reply from the forum from staff or gm .. even they fix it now .. in the future new bug will arrise and are you willing to wait 6 months before they fix it and that 6 months is 10 chance they will fix it .. i guess nuff saidgood game but no love in ITOS server ..  
"Product received for freeDon't get me wrong, this is a fun game, but it needs improvement before it can be truly enjoyable.My largest gripe with this game is its lack of an unrestricted trading & market system. This added so much of a social element to a game, and it's very disappointing that this game limits its complete use to people who are able to pay. This restriction severely handicaps someone's ability to obtain currency in the game, unless they can pay at least $32 a month.$32 a month. Ridiculous - they need to offer a way to buy a coin directly and nothing more - $13-14 for 1 mo? 15? Something reasonable jeez I feel like I'm being shaken down here."
IMC been try so hard to fight against bot issues with restriction blah blah blah.... they also banned innocent people who are using WTFast (Including me and My friends). Bad Ping/lag spikes are painful trust me dnt even think to waste your time here...
"Great concept, but poor execution on the part of IMC, resulting in a MMO that feels like a laggy, restrictive Single Player game with the option of buying gold and premium items. Seeing how the game is making cash, highly doubt that there will be any significant changes to improve the gameplay for legit players anytime soon."
"very bad for say ""SEA"" but some region cant even play, why not just change the title to ""Tree of savior SEA w/o Indonesia"".another else is bad server, hell yeah. another indie game dev even can run more smoother server"
"I am heavily looking forward to this game.Right now, this game is still a ""work in prgoress"" -- but seeing how deep this game has, it should be understandable why there is still a lot of work to be done."
"Simply in love with this game. Artstyle, fairytale like atmosphere and lots of classes and choices to make! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves cute anime like stuff though the population leaves a lot to be desired. (to resolve this problem you might wanna play on japanese version)"
"Although I really like this game's mechanics, visual and the really awesome sound design/soundtrack, I don't recommend it. I do it mainly because the developers handle it poorly: they don't focus on fixing important things (instead, keep adding more and more bugs), albeit the game really needs it; they don't do interesting events to interact with players; SA server is located at NA (LOL) and was buggy as hell when it was in Brazil; game blocks many basic actions, like trading, for premium users... and so on. Don't play it, because if you do, you'll be supporting a failure named IMC Games."
"I wish Steam had a middle-ground option. The game is a lot of fun, even if you don't want to pay money. Plenty of content, good looking environments. It IS a bit of a grind-fest.The problem is the server populations are composed of a metric crap-ton of bots and the actual players are farming rare drops in lower zones and so a zone instance can easily have NO MOBS IN IT.  Zero. I traversed an entire zone and encountered 3 mobs. There were several archer bots running around though. I assume they were bots, most players don't name themselves ""hUuWUISI"" and ""IWNAoofiawi"".You can't use the trade board for 3 days after you join a server, which was done to help prevent RMT bots from selling crap on the board; problem is there are easy workarounds for that, so all it does is keep you, the new player, from being able to get decent cheap low end gear.So, should you try it out? Yes. Should you stick with it and play it as a primary MMO? Probably not."
Has a very nostalgic Ragnarok Online feel to it which hits the sweet spot for me. It has some latency issues and stuff at the moment but it's still technically beta so I forgive it for that. It has some unique features such as collection chests that give stat boosts to all your characters if you complete them. It's been fairly entertaining for me to just explore around and do the various sidequests. I also really enjoy how much variety and openess is available in the class system.
"One of the best MMO out here for now. The publisher is too kind and linient with the players. I feel like the publisher are getting pushed around trying to meet the every demands of their players including those trolls and those who seriously no brainer kids out there. now that they extended the date of the F2P sever i am sure that more of those trolls will come complaining stating worst game eva n stuff like that. Now i wan to lend my powers to IMC and give a good review and recomend everyone who is unsure if this game is fun or not.IF you are a new player just starting out, it might be scary as there is so many choices in jobs. its always best to visit the forum first and have a birds eye view on the skill build they have. some of the skill build at tos base is out dated. so dun bother going there to have a look at their build. Forum is the best sources and the most reliable info about a job you can get. go there."
"After playing this game for a while now I feel ready to give it a review. Tree of savior is a great MMORPG with excellent points, it does have its setbacks but I’m sure these can be ironed out over time.I feel obliged to say this isn't Ragnarok online so down voting it because it ""lacks"" the same features as Ragnarok is downright silly. It does have some features similar but please go in with an open mind.Unfortunately this game has been targeted aggressively by “silver sellers” who spam chat regularly in an attempt to sell in game currency for real money. You can get around this however with an add on which is very easy to install to filter out the spam, IMC are making an effort to remove this problem from the game and post regular lists of accounts suspended for selling in game currency. Do the right thing and don’t buy silver for real cash, it supports these spammers."
"I love this game. The art style, the setting, the gameplay, the class system and strategy, etc.It's fresh. I never played RO or RO2 - but the game is fresh and pretty smooth for a launch despite some poor optimization.I know little to nothing about IMC but I think they're doing a good job - even with the pricing/DLC complaints people have.Having said that - I am giving this game a positive review but can say that there need to be several MAJOR changes before it hits release.The US is the only country that doesn't require a social security input in order to play - so having said that. We are the primary market for the gold sellers... what that means is that the game gets FLOODED with gold sellers and bots which damn near ruins the experience. Please make this game ""buy to play"" and consider revising some of the ingame uneccessary restrictions.Free to play makes a lot of sense and is an attractive incentive to try the game overseas - but not here. Here it makes the game a marketplace and invites the gold sellers to take advantage.Give it a try for free when it hits launch - but know that it would be worth (and a lot better) a $15-20 fee to purchase with a cosmetic cash shop."
"Product received for freeSeriously, the community of the game is so bad, I was on SEA server. not sure about others server. I dont really care about the p2w or the gameplay, for me it is just same as all the others mmorpg game. What matters to me is the community, in tree of savior, interaction between players is so less. Maybe it could be the reason of the style of the gameplay itself? I don't know. Hardly knew few friends, and all the things people care about is grinding. There is no chit-chat going on, no role playing, and nothing. As conclusion:Tree of GrindingTree of Ksing"
I like the art a lot. The game play and mechanics are really nice too. Things that could use some improvement would be 1) performance (almost unplayable with a huge crowd in one area); 2) class balancing (some class circles are downright wasteful); 3) rare equipment variation (very few choices on what rare equipment to use).
"It's lots of fun! I played a bit of RO some years back and this is just enough similarities to be nastalgic, but it's a completely different game. Lots of customability in the characters classes and a bit of customability in the character creation. I really like how you get a ""team"" name. I've personally not ran into really any bugs and I started playing opening morning :3 Love this game and can't wait to see what is to come!"
"Have been stuck at loading screen for 10 ♥♥♥♥ing days in a row. All I get is either an automated response which autoflags my ticket as ""answered"" or useless ""contact us again if the issue persists"" messages which also make the ticket flagged as ""answered"". Support is non-existant, optimisation is 0, the only good part about this game is its concept."
"This game is very bad not detail full of repetitive and nonsense questFor example: u need to pull stupid grass or sth for five repetative questeach one need about 10 sec to find and interact u need like 8-10grass per questAnd you need to do it five times WTH where is the fun part of it?Many item use same icon you can call it reuse or recycle they just change name of the itemsTons of boss but lack of its content all boss are the sameSame trick no challengeDungeon make me feel repetative too Monsters in dungeon is reuse from adventure just HP multiply by fiveI play a lot of MMOrpg like WoW, Rift, Elderscroll online, Guildwars 2 but this is THE WORST MMOrpg EVER"
"Probably the worst costumer service in the games industry.The game is actually pretty good. Nice OST, art, gameplay, but the connection isues got me (sometimes not even being able to log into the game). For me it was the biggest problem and the motive for me to leave the game. IMCashgrab is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ so do not expect this game to be fixed. Its been, what? 4 months since release (by the time i'm writing this) and almost nothing has changed.  RIP, ToS, it was a good hype."
+Great customization+Good gameplay+Great music+Fantastic art and style+Just a nice RO feel to it-Trade restriction-Laggy at times-Gold sellers (Tho blocking them is fast and easy)Overall the game is great. However some functions are designed poorly. But considering they consist of such a small percentage of the overall game and experience the pros far outweigh the cons. I came here for the RO experience not Recettear.
"As much as I want to love this game because it helps cope with RO nostalgia, it takes so many steps back in what we're used to having on an MMORPG that whatever enjoyment I get from it is quickly overtaken by the myriad bad features and issues it has.From the issues with mob density (Not nearly enough enemies for multiple parties to grind in one channel), to backwards restrictions (Really? Can't trade cash shop items between characters, or even silver?) and severe optimization issues/lag... it's not something I can recommend to others.That said, I sincerely hope that these issues are addressed in time, because right now I get the impression that the game is simply bleeding players at a fast rate (at least the amount of people you see in otherwise popular spots in the EU server has dramatically decreased)."
"Won't start a lot of the time, riddled with gamebreaking bugs, very boring skills. Was hoping this would be like Ragnarok but better yet somehow it is worse 14 years later. Still hopeful that the devs will turn it around but right now it barely works and is pretty boring."
"Now, I know what you're thinking. Mostly negative reviews, aggregate of them are listed as mixed, overall not a sign of a good time. I'm not gonna say the game is perfect, and I may be a bit biased as I have a friend to play this with, but I still think this is a good game.If you want a lot of stuff to do, a lot of story, a lot of side-story, it's here, and it's here in droves. Not always quality, but you always have a reason for what you're doing, and if you take it in a humorous light rather than a serious one on some of the reasons NPCs have for you doing quests, you can have some good fun with it. As far as the class system, I have to give it loads of points. There's no one way to build a character; sure, you'll have people tell you the most efficient/powerful builds, but that goes for any game. What style of play you're enabled to do, what weapons you use, it's all completely up to you to decide with the plethora of choices you have. You can be a tanky dragoon, a glass cannon Barbarian, a crit-based Hoplite, all up to you. And while starter skills for a class are pretty plain and vanilla, there's nothing new with that, but any game where you seriously can throw your spear and have to go get it or plant down a pirate flag is a plus in my book.The art and music are out of this world. It's a very unique style that I have yet to see in another MMO. I wouldn't even take a moment to be able to tell any screenshot of this game or basically five seconds of any track from what you find in this game apart from anything else. You may not have much character customization (and you may wonder how I'm about to tie this in), but the style of the art is good enough that it feels deserved to keep it somewhat minimal. I'd rather have a few good options than a hundred throwaway, barely different options.However, I do have to give heavy marks down for the NA servers for the general population of the game. I'm not going to pretend to know who to point fingers at, but it's not just this MMO that I see the problem that I see here, which is that nobody cares to cooperate. There's just AFK shops at towns and maybe a handful of people barely moving about or looking too preoccupied with what they're doing otherwise, and it's very tough to find other people out in the field to party with. Shouts are pretty much just for people to go dungeon crawling with or to somewhat organize for field bosses, maybe one or two here for guilds, but that's it. As I said, however, this seems to be a common problem for MMOs that have a server just for NA. I'm not sure that I can fault the game for it so much as I can fault our culture.TL;DR: Music and art are godly, class variety is pretty great, and while the quality of story is either questionable or by-the-numbers at points, they have sunk a lot of time and effort into trying to establish a side-story for each and every place you visit as well as something of an overarching lore. However, if you're looking an exception among the MMOs here in NA that face the widespread problem of people failing to be friendly or form up groups that are not entirely self-serving, this sadly will not be the game for you. If you can, bring a friend, and I promise you that this game will be tons of fun, moreso than if you play alone - but again, this applies to any MMO."
"Product received for freeNice game in theory, the art looks amazing toosadly ingame it feels horrible, i tried multiple control schemes but none were nice and the hitboxes and targetting feel horrible, the servers have also had lots of issues :/ after an 8 hour maintinece a server is bugged and only p2p players can login to it (this is only meant to be for a different server, even the error message says its the other server thats p2p only) so now f2p dont have anywhere to go really apart from super crowded places. "
"This game is just going from bad to worse. Not only it's an unfinished product, they've decided to officially launch it for some reason. Feels exaclty like Wakfu did.I bought the ""1 month headstart"" pack (amazing isn't it), capped my char to 280 in about 20 days, just to feel that I got at least 10% of my moneys worth.They've had several ""bugfixes"" and patches and it just kept going downhill.Game coding is all messed up, even on a high end PC some zones have horrible fps. (i7/980ti)The game design turned lazy at one point with their map bonus introduction.Lots of useless classes, thus in the end while having the illusion that we can combine all sorts of classes, in the end only 2-3 combinations are viable.When it went f2p, I've started a new account to level extra classes and teh only thing that changed is that they gained way more bots.   The saddest part is that they aren't even considering to do anything about this. They have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bot report system that shows no effect what so ever. Same Macro users and Bots have been here for over a month now.Every 3rd player you see out there is a bot. Even players themselves are macro afking in multiple grind spot zones.In fact, they should just rename the game to Bots of Savior.This game looks like it still needs another good 1-2 years to refine and finish. However their greed got to their head and decided to launch an unfinished sad product.It's probably best for them private servers to come out. At least those handle bots a lot better."
"Queue in position 1k+ waiting.. waiting.. waitng.. until it 0. Finally is my turn to go in the server, suddenly it gave me a note "" Disconnect from server""  WTH.. How many times do I hav to queue in to play a game? The server is overload"
"Product received for freeI had high expectations for this, even tho i didnt want to buy early access i was pretty hyped. Now i am happy i didnt. Game has a lot of flaws, most major atm are server issues, euro server is not even that populated and it constantly lags, i am playing archer and i do double dps when it doesnt lag. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ auction system - you cant buy/sell anything for 72 hours when you start to play, when you finally can start selling tooltips on items you put on auction(average price and stuff) are completely wrong, you need to check every material(and after 72 hours i had about ~90 of them) manually. But that isnt everything, even if you manage to sell something you need to wait 48 hours to get your silver. This makes absolutely no sense to me.Other major issue is forced party play. Being in a group gives you more xp then solo. In full group you can get 450% more xp per monster, considering half of the areas are dead/close to dead this makes no sense again. Why should solo gameplay be punished in a grinding game, i have no idea.Next issue is dungeon queue. Considering you get even more bonus xp(600%) if you dont make premade group for dungeon, you need to queue for some to get good xp. Well, 99% of the time you just gonna stare at 'Searching for party' window for hours if you have nothing else to do. Also game has no info on dungeon locations, but that is tolerable considering queue mechanic itself. Queue should be long distance and not require you to wait at dungeon entrance, period. Oh and 1 more thing about dungeons, 90% of the time you get nothing, there are total 2(+1 when you get premium token) entrances COMBINED per day. Actually its not that bad since you cant even find group for 1 dungeon, lol.Now about good stuff, art/locations/quests are actually pretty enjoyable, characters are really cute. But considering party play will probably stay same and I am really not a fan of grinding normal monsters with other people, i have doubts i am gonna enjoy playing this game further."
"Graphic: Better than RagnarokAnimations: Better than RagnarokMusic: Ragnarok BGM remix versionsClasses: Just as diverse and complicated as in RagnarokMaps: PrettyMonsters: Super mega hyper easy to kill at begin, they wont even damage you.Gameplay: Easy to walk and control, hard to aim monsters, typical main/sidequest-lineIt's great game overall, might get a little grindy and boring after a while I guess."
Cons:Only thing you can do is change your hairstyle.Options are limited.Keybindings are strange and a lot of them seem redundant.No way to unbind keybinds.No notice that there was maintenance in the launcher.Bright red and orange text that shows up on the screen is unreadable.Pros:Very pretty artstyle.f you're a fan of RO... then you *might* like this.Maybe TOS mobile will be better...
"TL;DR (take away message): The devs don't care about this game, and there is no reason left for anyone else to care either.I can not recommend this game. I would truly love to... but I simply can not. I had high hopes for the game and was looking forward to a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online (during its prime). Sadly, the game has gone downhill since initial release and is showing no sign of recovery. Despite a lot of potential, nostalgia, and an actually good game at its core... the overall experience is a poor and frustrating one. The biggest culprit, I feel, is the dev team itself at IMC games. A persistent disregard for the community has lead to their rare attempts to fix issues being so idiotic and heavy handed that they hurt the general player base more than the offending parties. More often than not, serious issues are unresolved or even just not acknowledged... while the in game premium/cash shop seems to never be neglected. I have played on and off since launch day, and many bugs and other problems (ranging from annoying to gamebreaking) present at launch have yet to be fixed. Add to that simply terrible optimization resulting in even good machines being slowed down by the overly simple graphics, and very few people have stuck around.This has lead to a decline in the player base to the point where you will very often be the only one in a zone, with most towns populated by fewer than a dozen AFK shops. Unfortunately, this is one more case of a good opportunity lost due to a bad company. It looks like this game is the real one that needed a ""Savior."""
It's really a decent game but managed really badly. Very laggy plus game seems broken because has server maintenance. Game has it's appeal but it tries everything to make you hate the game.
addictive. i like the way it lures gamers into spent online purely because of the game play....means it's a good game. you spent your money on a game while playing/ you dont need to but thats its attractive concept. well done
"10/10 would CoC againSeriously though, this game is really good. the combat is fun and strategy is important. Time management is a must. Risk and reward is a big part of the game. Lots of areas to explore. Theres not much more I could ask for. the game is really fun for me and it may be fun for you too. :D"
"Recommended for people who love massively multiplayer space war games. Couldn't find anything so detailed on the internet untill i've found this. With some patience and willpower, you can become top player in no time.Cheers."
"Pro: Takes time to do most things, thus limiting the amount played at any given time, good graphics for the game style.Con: Takes time to do most things, not much of a storyline, not a lot to do other than ""gear grind, very limited open world feel.""Summary: Good game to pass some time in-between games, especially since most things are ""time based.""  Aside from ""gear grinding"" though, not a whole lot to do.         ***Revision to review (bottom) added 11/7/2017, original review (top) made 06/21/2016.***   I am a casual gamer, so i don't invest a whole lot of resources in the games i play.  I take my time in the games i play and enjoy myself, i already have a full-time job, i'm not looking for another.         I reiterate what i said before in my review.  Researching, repairing, and constructing things takes time, the higher level, the more time it takes, the more damage to repair, the more time it takes.  You can only repair one fleet at a time (they should make it where you can repair more than one fleet at a time, or research or build more than one thing at a time, if you pay real money for it, beings it's a Free To Play game.)  Honestly, the only things that don't take allot of time (for the most part) are the battles.          A great way to compare this game is if EVE Online was a base building RTS with ""small scale"" fleets (each fleet being no more than 6ish ships for players.)  For combat, everything is open world.  Meaning you seek out (or get sought out) opponents, npc or player alike, in an open universe.  The actual ""combat"" takes place in instances that are made on the spot to keep other players/npc's from jumping in and ganking you during combat.          The nice thing about this game is that you can spend as much or as little time at any given time as you want.  Play casually and have one or two fleets and kill as many npc's or players as you like, send ships home to repair, maybe research/upgrade your base (or ships before you send them out) and go play something else.  Or play more hardcore and have allot of fleets and do allot of combat at any given time.          There is a little risk of higher lvl players harassing lower level players, but there is a restriction.  A lvl 40 player fleet can't attack a lvl 20 player fleet  (but there is no lvl restriction on a player attacking an npc fleet, just warnings not to attack too high lvl npc's.)  I'm not 100% positive on the rules of pvp, seeing as i don't do pvp.  Only very specific npc's will attack your fleets or bases.          But i think the thing i love about this game the most, is that it reminds me of one of my all-time favorite games, Robot Rising.  Where you have to split your time/resources between your fleets (or robot in Robot Rising) and your base.  The only difference between Vega Conflict and Robot Rising in that regard is that in Vega Conflict, the enemy can attack your base, which i think is an excellent concept.  It makes the player more invested in their base, as opposed to not caring about it as much and focusing on their charcter/fleet.  I would love to see a return of Robot Rising, but until then, Vega Conflict will hold me over.          Despite all the bad reviews, Vega Conflict thankfully doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.  In regards to the ""microtransaction"" claims, i have only spent $10 on this game.  Enough to get the Commerce Module so i can generate coins for free (coins are used to purchase special items at certain times as opposed to grinding for them, or accelerate repairs/research/building.)  I may spend more in the future to help the developers, but until then, it is only necessary to spend money if you want to save time.          Between YouTube videos, the community, and the corperation i'm in, i've had all of my questions answered and help received.  The community does make for a fun game, and there is still more than enough players playing to find friends and opponents.  ::)"
"Recommended ? Yes AND No.-Extremely fun when you're a low level (first 10 hours)-Okay when you're a mid-level (next 20 hours)-When you're an end-gamer this game becomes more of a micro-transaction demanding game. (after 100+ hours)Its free to play~ but what they dont tell you is it's PAY TO WIN.Here's the breakdown;5 USD gets you 500 coins, 100 USD gets you 12,000 coins (2k bonus)1 coin cuts you down 3 minutes of repair timeOne end-gamer fleet can go as much as 12-18 hours of repair PER fleetTherefore its literally paying 2.5 USD each time your fleet gets destroyed, or wait a staggering 15 hours average PER fleet, you have 7 fleets.To build 1 of those end-game fleets, it will probably take you a month. (one ship builds from 5-12 days depending on what you're building)However if you're still making up your mind, then here's an actual live recorded footage by me caught in action between the top 20 alliances in this game just going at it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghwNRV_uTP0A lot do recognize me as CODE Aldnoah in game, because i'm one of the best pilots around that spends the least while getting the most results (9 fleet kills in a row) *Side note* Clash of Clans is actually a clone of Backyard Monsters developed by Kixeye, which also happened to be the developer of this game. (Google it)So I hope that clears things up, hope it helps :^)"
"For a potential O-game varient i had hope this would be better then the previous varients of this game type.Combat is fun, The game mechanics work well. BUT the time waiting game has me in tears. I want to proceed and battle new things but hours upon hours of waiting and repeating the same old thing over and over AND OVER OMG could you have organised this any worse? Oh don't worry pay money to speed up this slow boring uniteresting grind of a unrewarding time sync. I will NOT recommend this to anyone.Im sitting waiting for my ships to repair when i could be scrubbing the decks, replacing broken bits having some sort of mechanical interaction to make the ""repair time"" interesting but no a big fat Clock with a little slot for money to speed things up sits in my way of fun.Ships are nice Atmosphere is great, sounds...i swear are stolen from places. Regardless. This game is not worth the time i spent on it nor anymore of my time.I hope the dev team try again on another space game ill keep an eye out."
"Still play, in a big alliance,only spent $150 in 2 years. Yes its a grind and Kixeye could do with slowing it down a little, But no matter what they do do people moan. Come have a go, you do not have to spend. Stay out of the rat race and just enjoy the game. Its fun just to start and see where you end up, you can leave at anytime."
This game is for sure one of the best made free-to-play games. Devs did a great job; I can tell they've changed a lot of stuff since it was only an in-browser game. This is certainly worth trying out.
could be great game but on the updates are focused on making them money  after the first few levels ups you tire of playing  unless your spend money.   but who wants to pay for what they even call a free game.
"It does seem interesting, at first and looking at the youtube playthrough/guides videos. However, once I started the game, I realised that game progression and 1 module are hidden behind a pay wall which you can't unlock unless you actually pay. So much for ""free play"". Ok so let's talk about that. Microtransactions seem designed to offer better returns if you make smaller, regular transactions, rather than big ones. Which should be fine for most players.  So far so good. Certain actions that are needed for progression (like building/upgradin modules, researching) are massively impacted by what you can purchase, which can speed up your progression. That's not so good.  Things that impact your survivability, like ship repairs and even their speedy build times are also unfairly impacted by what you can buy in the game. Not cool. Overall progression is way too slow for my taste and had it been any smoother, I might have been tempted to play more and maybe even pay (I don't want to give them any ideas), but as it is now, I wouldn't even bother. Game design is not that good either. The overall idea is nice and they have some interesting, elements, but it's an obvious shameless money grab. Don't like it one bit and it's simply in your face: not enough resource, click here to get more. The UI is not intuitive enough, no tool-tips, no warning when spending stuff that you might need later on (though actions can be cancelled in a timely fashion and you get resources back). I haven't realised in the first 30 min how to properly arrange my base, just with the info available in-game. Not cool. Please have the decency to stay away from this one and others like it. Had they came up with more gameplay and less annoying pay-us-money shameless tactics, I would have been ok-er with it, messing around, but the way it is calls for a single verdict: stay away from this one!"
"YES!!! I do not like playing games in browsers, but I put up with it for this game. Now that I can play it as a downloaded game?? Oh! What a releif. Although, I would like linux support in the future if you guys can spare the resorces. Maybe a windows 10  App? That last one might never happen since you put it on steam. Nevertheless.. Im glad I am out of the browser."
"states 2.2 hrs played, well thats on steam. been playing Vega now for almost a year!Pay to win? The game is going that way but you can still have a great time! I do spend but very minimum and thats usually to repair my fleets whilst we have a war! Best thing to do, Don't steal resources from other players, keep quiet on the comms and study the clans/alliances before you request entrance. In my experience finding the right clan made this game! If it wasn't for the alliance/clan that I was/am  in i would have quit a long time ago.Be prepared to be trolled in comms, be prepared to be blasted out of the sky, be prepared for your base to be destroyed multiple times, prepare for a great game. base building upto level 25 is pretty easy. I recommend if you coin spend real money) don't spend on the buildings or resources. Talk to people in your planet or your system, there are some old timers who will help you if needed. (good luck in finding them)there are youtube instructional videos as well which help with base building and fleet building.Just have fun"
"This is a good game even if you don't have alot of time to play it.Some things take Minutes while others take Hours, or even Days, later, depending on how far you are in making it so it requires less attention."
"Very fun game!  Takes patience and determination to get the ball rolling, but once you do its a lot of fun!  Kixeye added a lot of very good features to the game that have been helpful!  I played the game a while ago when it first came out.  It was fun then, and I was sad to see Unity support die off on Chrome.  Very happy Kix put it on Steam!"
"Kixeye is a greedy company.  They've taken a game that was fun and was also profitable for them and started squeezing more and more out of their gamers.  Welp this last update/rebalance is garbage and has ruined the game.  I highly recommend you stay away from this game and publisher, unless you just want to be screwed by them."
I have been playing Kixeye games for a wile. first battle pirates and the hacking was ludachris. at least this game does not appear to have a ton of hackers like BP. I do feel BP was a more social game then VC. in BP you would hear people talking to eachother all day where in VC you can go quite a wile without any chatter. I like it tho
quite a fun game if you can wait for the looooong construction&research times and/or has some spare money to spare on a web game.Join a noob friendly alliance in your sector and sometimes get your base fukked by some bastard and sometimes fukk the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them bastards.WARNINGThis game is P2W so you will get fukked A LOTmy points 8/10
"For a mobile game, this is great. The pc version allows me to record anything I want, for example a sector raid, sometimes it's fun when several alliances come together to form a large group of fleets somewhere around 50 or more players and have hundreds of battles. Compared to other pc games, for example Team Fortress 2. This game isn't very good. I mostly plan on playing the game on my mobile device, not my pc, that is why I'm giving this a thumbs up. The graphics are very good (for a mobile game), and it's unnecessary to ""pay to win"". It just takes longer to do certain things."
"Really interasting,fun and addictive. Really deep base building, ship creation and fleet management. Expand your base, conquer planets with your alliance, do whatever you want. Real time PvP, PvE. Great game solid 9.3/10. The only bad thing about the game is it gets repetitive some times when you have to grind some certain enemy fleets to get that much resources to upegrade that one thing. But all in all a great game, a MUST TRY GAME!-And for the people saying its Clash of Clans in space, ♥♥♥♥ you, this game is much deeper, better base building, resource managemen.... and so on. Just play it!"
SOOO addicting i used too have battle pirates until it got too new for my computer and this is that just way funner i want too do a lets play series with this...can anybody recomend softwares too use when recording it... if so please dm me or steam message me
"Very fun game with a large and active global community.serious Pay to win issues temper that fun, as does the endless grinding.Find a good coining alliance and spend the five bucks to get a commerce center.Seeya in sector comms :)"
"Pay To WIN! Although this game is fun, i dont like how the matrix shield works when you get attaked.For example, if a player comes and destroys your base, you should get the matrix shield even if you get hit about 12 times.Allinall, its enjoyable."
"Great Game, But this is more of a suggestion then a comment.Cargo Ships.They have 0 or 1 gun, and they start with a TON of cargo, but they are helpless if left undefended, this could be great for VSec Special Events, Like a mass cargo convoy moving through the sector, I hope you take the Idea!"
"If you have a mac i would highly not recommend getting this game i have re-instaled this 4 times and none of those times has this game worked. Everytime i open it says ""you need to open this game from steam."" I have done this and it has not worked. and or the game gets frozen on the loading screem and from the reviews this game does not look to good."
"I honestly like this game,(Although some may disagree) The Build times are long,but that is what makes it interesting,(NOT FOR IMPATIENT PEOPLE)Pros-Unlike most nowaday strategy games,this one allows you to take most control of the battle,such as mauvering units around-With long buildtimes also comes with the encouragement to upgrade the most valuble structures first before moving on-Decent Gameplay-Playable on Virtually any WiFi connection as when you upgrade your ships enough,its not even nessecary to take control of battles-Decent Interfaces(Thankfully it explains interfaces in-game,otherwise people might find it too complex)Cons-I can't think of any(I dont know why i listed this under cons then)"
"vega conflict is a game of strategy and time lol needless to say mostly all u do is farm and upgrade....there are many ways to play this game though, you can go solo or with an alliance... It is fun to be in a guild alliance whatever u wanna call it. The game has good sound effects and a good soundtrack. Its pretty trippy soundtrack actually u can just zone out on the different planets and whatnot... The game is great is you have alot of time and you enjoy social games where u can play with an alliance or solo if you dont like the social aspect. Overall the game is well made with its different types of fleets and weaponry :) There is only one thing i do not like about the game and that is alot of people pay to win in it. Coining in the game has gotten big.... The game can be played for free, and it has events in which u can win various different blueprints for ships etc. I am enjoying this game thus far and would recommend it to anyone who like strategy and resource farming along with long upgrades... I would give the game a solid 7/10 as it lacks some aspects but makes up for others. The game is free what are you waiting for join me xD"
"Been playing Vega conflict for a year now and i can say its The best strategy game of its type.There is so much you can do with your base and your fleets,so many different types of weapons,armor,sheilds it goes on and on.Some people are saying it is pay to win,no its not,does it take a while to get some of the blueprint items?yes it does but it is a challenge and gives you a ton to do.Also the community on this game is superb,so many good people and if you join a good clan you can make some really good friends,i have.This game is a dedication and time well spent.Play and and see if its your thing.Also you can play this game on mobile device,phone,tablet,etc,so you can upgrade or build and even attack fleets and bases at work or where ever you are,very handy for reapiring and upgrading stuffHavent played this game for a year for nothing,Great game A+"
"Have been playing this game for awhile now. Have all the hulls and end game fleetsThe game is going backwards fast with the developer ignoring the community and doing nothing about bugs in the system itself,doing a dig your head in the sand movewith replies of,we dont know about that bug,good luck,your lossGaem balance is so out of touch its not worth it to start from new"
"At one time was an epic game... Robust with differnt tech and great inter-group communication within the game... It has turned more for profit... Steering away skill and knowledge to ""Farming"" endlsessly for tech that never seems to drop... Scripting is evident and the game makers have made no public decision to clamp down on it... Ships take weeks to build and to create an actual fleet could take you up to 3 months all to see it die within 5 minutes and repar for another 24 hours... Until they fix some major key issues and listen to the community this game will continue to go downhill..."

"A unique, free roaming, unrestricted PvP fleet command game marred by horrendeous ship class balancing (thank you crafting update), alliance bottom feeding 24/7 (thank you International Coining Union & friends), lengthy reviewing & wait times (thank you unreasonable repair rates; even <insert generic mobile space simulator> did this a lot better), and unreasonable PvE fleet balancing (if only my fighters used iridiums instead of plasteel).But why do veterans such as I continue exist in this game? Just like myself & many more suffering through Kixeye's vanity, we stay and ride the crowded wormhole down to the bottom in a vain attempt to discover the ultimate question: will Vega shatter into billions of regrets that cuts deep into our sub-conscious, or will it impact into a gigantic pancake to be served once more to the ragged masses that gathers underneath the table as scraps?"
"I love the game but since the last update their is a problem connecting through steam, and its verry frustrating, click support and u get its supported through kixeye, Kixeye tells you its a steam related issue contact steam support.wtf pull your heads out your asses already!!!!!"
"I have played the game for about 5 days now and I like it. To be competetive you have to spend real money, but if you're like me and just like to casually play and not be super competetive then it's fine not spending any money. I recommend it if you like casual gameplay and not looking to spend money at all, basically looking for an OK game. I DO NOT recommend if you want to dominate the void and play to the limits. You will have to spend too much money for a game."
"Can be a pretty fun strategy game for the first few hours.  That is until you reach certain building requirements which take hours upon hours to build.   My main complaint with Vega is that you cannot upgrade a building while you are building something else.  You can only do one of those two things at any time.  Want to add some armor to another structure?  Nope, you're upgrading something else, or, building a new structure....sorry! We can only do one of two things at any given time in this universe.  The game is screaming at you to buy gold.   Not through advertisements but through how slow the process takes to do anything.  Most of the game is spent in the planet view attacking npc's for resources.  The rest of the time, you're waiting.  If you want to attain any real progress, you need to buy gold to speed up production.  Just like in EVERY freemium game the real money currency is light years better than free.  You'll see max level players constantly attacking you every 12 hours because they can.  They've probably spent hundreds of dollars on the game and just spend their entire day attacking other players.  I gave it a thumbs up simply because the graphics and gameplay are engaging and it can be played on steam and your smart phone or tablet.  So the devs did a good thing by branching out like this.  They obviously know what they're doing because people are spending alot of real money on the game.   "
"This game is for people who have money. With that said...Me personally,  I don't mind shelling out some cash for this game as I love it, and have been playing it for years making me a veteren player. But the reviews are true. As a newbie into this game, you have no chance. Without getting with an alliance within days of starting to build you will get ripped to shreads as this game is so unbalanced and built for people to feed it with real cash. I have seen this game make people so angry that it litterally gets into peoples heads and makes them shell out $100's of dollars. Brilliant Programming in my opinion. I have seen countless people dump $1000's into this game...and I am not even exaggerating. One guy dumped close to $8000 to build one advanced fleet. I am getting close to a grand myself after two years. To be the best, you need to build...build..craft..craft...pay or wait..pay or wait..and fight. If you can handle that and you have some money to BURN this game is really fun. Know if you do spend real money, you will spend it quicker than you can dump it into a slot machine to repair ships, build fleets, grind events. Spending real money is a one click adventure in which you buy coins for a certain amount and spend them by one clicking on specific things to accomplish in the game...or you can wait the countless hours for the same activity to take place for Free. But what fun is that.  I've been doing this for 2+ years now. Love the game, but I knew what I was getting into. I don't know how long the game will last as there aren't to many like me who would dump so much into the game. I won't bash the game, because it is what it is...but if i was a newcomer...trust me i know where you are coming from. Maybe I will see you out there....or maybe this review steered you away. Either way, be smart with your money and spend it on what you like doing."
id like to add to all these negative comments of play to win its not so..i am leader of a good allaince in vega and most do not coin at all and are at good base levels for the time they have been playing.you dont have to coin and the game wasnt made to play all day every min its to kill some time here and there when you can.i have been playing a couple years now and its a good place to meet people and actually.i say check it out and find us in 3400 say your looking for Ray-Ray
"Warning this game is adicitive. The game itself is free and you can play it and win without coins but you need patience. There are frequent wars between players allancesand it is constantly evolving so it is not boring. you can just play against the ai but the main thing is player verses player and the massive wars. As an example 30,different allances joined together to fight a war against each other on two different sides . Given that each allance had about 40 players and each had 7 fleets it gives you an idea of the scale. There is also a level balance so that fleets cannot be too overpowered against each other no mater what your level."
this game is amazing and fun to play i find the best part is the amout of satisfaction you get after building a great fleet or destroying another players base. but recently it keeps on crashing causing me to have to deleat the game. 
"Great game to pass the time. Really challenging in the beginning, but once you get used to how the game feels, and where everything is, you are basically set. Would really recommend this to a friend"
"I started playing this on my android device and it was amazing, but the controls were kinda hard. Ever since i fifured out steam had it it made the game much easier to play and alot more fun."
"This game isn't bade like others have said and its not really pay to win it just speeds up the process.  This game is having a really... really bad time right now the devs don't really listen to their players like they used to and they make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ events to grab more money from loyal players, but they have promised a change the latest event maelstrom was probably testing the water's and if I was you i would start now and get a medium level base in the bad phase and when this game turns great again you can enjoy it like other players can. yea"
"I have enjoyed the process of strategy and warring against other players and the computers. The fleet and base battles are amazing and call for a knowledge of strategy. The only thing I don't enjoy about VEGA is that it takes time to build up your base, but besides that it is worth it."
"pay to win or not, it is a fun game and has great potential for multiplayer cooperation,  I woould say 20 hours to learn the basics.  alot of options and player control of fleet battles(this is where pay to win falters, if you learn your fleets) as an option,."
Much much more smoother on steam and better. Recommanded for those who love to waste time and get better because of it. Though I have one complaint. I can't go back to full screen mode anymore. The button is broken.
"Used to play on browser and mobile.""Oh I need the blueprints to use Gladius Driver II.""    Wait beside the planet    Cargos spawn    Defeat the lv35 cargoNo blueprint found...    Wait beside the planet    Cargos spawnlv35 cargo caught by another player...    Wait beside the planet    Cargos spawn    No lv35 cargo this time...(1h later)Blueprint found...But it is for another outfit...(10h later)Required blueprint found...1/6 completed...(50h later)6/6 completed...""Finally I can equip my fleet with Gladius Driver II now.""""Well I've collect all the lv35 blueprint techs, Now it's time for lv40.""“Here comes the event! Now it's time for the loot points.”""Oh KIXEYE introduced crafting. Now it's time for strongboxes.""Conclusion:Prepare yourself for a great number of highly routinely PVE battles to get stronger!"
Love it but they need to work on it a lot more before it's great. When I log in I get an error that says it must be launched through Steam. I don't have a icon for it on my desktop so the only way TO launch it is through Steam. I would appreciate if this mater was addressed as soon as possible.
I only have 64 hours on here but I am an end game player. I do have to give a thumbs up to the actual game. It is fun even after the rebalance. But kixeye as a company is horrible. Their forum moderators delete EVERYTHING and ANYTHING they do not like. The practice unfair business practices (Selling items that are supposed to be better knowing that soon they will be nerfed which we wouldn't have purchased after they made the changes.) The support do not keep logs of just about anything so do not expect much help if there are hackers/cheaters. Even when they blatenly break the rules. If you play this game you need to know that there are a LOT of shady things that happen that get covered up or erased till forgotten.
"It's a very good game if you know what you're doing. Don't be afraid to ask questions in sector chat if you need help. Asking questions can really help you advance in the game a lot. Also, if you aren't aftraid to spend a bit of money, using coins can come in handy. The offers in this game are very cheap compared to other pay to win games. Also, if you're a new player, I would reccomend using PC and not mobile. It's much easier to control your ships using a mouse. I would also reccomend to be cautous about increasing your base experiance. Try minimizing the amount of damage on your base with your layout. Bases aren't entirely built to defend early on. Other than that, don't count on getting the latest content early on. That's right, don't. Focus on getting to the next tier instead. It will be less overwhelming if you get in that mindset. Othefr than that, good work Kixeye! Please put old hulls, tech, and weapons back in to events so new players can get them too"
"Word to the wise. If you put time into this, you will probably put more money into this than a season pass game. This game does not forgive mistakes, and it's sole goal is the long haul. It has a community of those who care far too much for the game, as demonstrated by the sudden increase of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But enough of that, here are the facts.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--It's going to take about a year to get up to end gamer level at the most basic level.--Most tech is based on weekly to bi weekly events, you won't be touching those for a while.--You need to make allies, or learn how to play quickly if you want to catch up within a reasonable period of time.--Building fleets and bases are an art unto itself. It takes time, the further you progress this turns from days to weeks.--All progress moves forward unless the player itself deletes it.--There are protections for new players, but also disadvanages.--If you play this game, after a certain point, your weekends may be forfit until you invest in higher end equipment.--You will have a significant learning curve and disadvantage until you recieve event tech.--The game core dynamics have recently changed, you will have an edge if you can find a way to adapt.--The community can be toxic as all hell, but they love the game.--Like fight club there are 2 rules. The first is that there are no rules, and second is that you do not ask about the rules.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In short it's a fun game I've sunk plenty of time into, but it is going to be difficult for a newcomer to put their time into. It's not to say that there is a significant learning curve, but it is stacked against you in comparision to much easier MMOs.Regardless, best of luck in the void rebels."
"Free to play game.   Pay to be competitive. I've got more than the time spent in game as I played back during the browser era before it became a client on steam.You can fully enjoy this game as a free player.  However as you progress through levels, being competitive on a pvp/pve scale requires using ""Coins"" which are bought through real money.  I remain a free to play player.  So after my expensive fleet gets destroyed from pvp or pve, I have a 12 hour repair time before I can use that fleet again.  I could spend a few bucks and have it ready instantly but my play style doesnt demand that.  I can simply wait until the next day and use that fleet again.The development of the game has its ups and downs.  Certain fleet configurations that work exceptional well have been ""balanced"" to prevent them from being used without needing to repair more and if you want them ready instantly (pay real money)its fun to play and more fun with a team of people.  Id not recommend the game for someone trying to be competitive /end game without RL funds to back up insta fleeting. "
"Been playing Vega Conflict for a year and it is doable if you dont spend anything on it. But its highly reccomented you get the commerce module for your base (around £5) then you will get free coins.One of the things I like most about this game is the infinate ship configurations you can have, and Kixeye for all there faults are continueing to develop the game.If you are into sifi and MMO type games then this is for you. Just expect to get beat up for the first few months like in any other game of this type."
"Love this game, love the graphics & the sound is brilliant.The only thing that i think would make this game miles better would be a better alliance system.for example,      mailing system, that you can email alliance members or potential alliance members or if your just looking for an alliance to join."
"Have been playing Vega for almost a year now and I love it.Yes, it could be argued that it's a 'pay-to-win' game, however the only thing you can buy is time, e.g. as the examples below say, it can take two weeks to build a ship, but once you have it you never have to make it again!you can't buy any part of the game that you can't get with good old time and hard work.8/10 for the game. would recommend any day."
"Well it was a lot of fun for the first few hours. Loved the tutorial. Once I hit level 20, everything slowed down to a crawl. Wish we gained skill points after gaining base levels. As of right now I have nothing to do. I'm waiting on my Fleet Bay to upgrade which takes 1 day 12 hours. I could farm parts to upgrade my ships but that's pointless as they will become obselete once I unlock more powerful ships. While I like the UI, I don't care for how the base looks. A lot of the structures look similiar, so it can be confusing trying to figure out what building does what.  Or finding a specific one. I had to pull my monitor up closer because your base quickly becomes a cluster. I really enjoyed my short time with this game but there are several things that need to be tweaked to make it flow better. A couple things off the top of my head are: being able to zoom out further at base. Base layout options. When refitting (adding mods/weapons) to a single ship at the Fleet Bay, why is the game sending me OUT of the Fleet Bay to the base when I need to manage 16 ships as of now. That's incredibly ANNOYING. We should be able to copy layouts of ships and be able to easily move ships around in formation to reduce the monotony. Please for the love of god, reduce the upgrade and repair times!  I'm not paying to speed those things up. I end up finding other games to play while I wait.For a free game, it was worth playing it for a few hours, but it wouldn't be something to come back to in my opinion."
"I've played to game close to 40 house straight, very addicting They severerly need to overhaul the controls for it, espically for the PC, its near immposible simetimes to do anything you need to restart the game. Visusual are stunning, if they had put a few more months into the game a few more features I could totally see myself spending 40-50 bucks or a game like this."
Its a really fun game when you get with some cool people but it can easily go south do to the high amount of tablet kids throwing tamtrums and getting 150 people to attack you and your alliance since they spend all their allowance on coins. but if you can stay under the radar like i do its very fun and a great way to spend time while waiting for your pizza or getting stuck in a long slow drive through. hahah I give it about a 8/10.
I like this game its fun i just wish you can make it so you can attack anyone too see how good you are to some top players instead of just attacking people lke your level and plus the internet conncections sometimes i can't even get on you need to get a better connection
"I used to play this game on the Kixeye website before it was brung into Steam, and I loved it. (Especially cool that my uncle is part of the developement team!) Now that I saw this in my discovery que, and decided to give it a try again, I'll definitely be playing more! Good move putting this on Steam!"
"Only one of its kind, verry addictive, and user friendly, semi-okay graphics for best experience. 5/5 Stars. It is time consumeing ( similar to an RTS ) But extreamly fun., and a good way to meet people."
"I have to say that this is a pretty fun game. It has been about 2 weeks now since I started. The ships are many, even if the graphics aren't amazing 3D. But what I enjoy about this is the strategy, building fleets and other elements. Just realized you can group ships in your fleet. So that helps in creating a strategy in taking down an enemy player's base. When it comes to ships, its important to learn what best ships can do what. I usually set up fleets for specific roles.Like space, there are multiple planets that revolve around their stars as well as systems and sectors, so you can really go out to battle across sector and planetary space! See a player traveling through space? Attack it :)There are micro transactions but even those don't really help you much since upgrading things once you are about level 18 take a lot more ""gold"" to instantly upgrade. So my take on this is to upgrade and just go on to raid lower lvl AI fleets.Everything is in real-time so you may be battling a fleet here but another player is attacking your unguarded base."
"This is a game of patience. Upgrading the components to your base will take months, and meanwhile there are rare items and blueprints to gather from NPC fleets and special events. You need all of it, so keep your progress even. There are plenty of events for low level players every month, but some are only meaningful for higher levels.You can spend money, or not. If you choose to spend money, paying to win is very expensive. There are players who have been playing the game for years and are in so deep they spend a few hundred dollars every month.The big downsides are that while there are rules against scripts/bot farming and multiple accounts, the rules are not enforced. Also, sector chat is often filled with foul-mouthed children. Despite that, the game is pretty fun and new content is added regularly."
"NOTE: I'm playing on a Mac. Chances are, it'll be different for you.It just keeps crashing. It's getting really annoying. At one time, it actually didn't crash, though. It then told me to click on the ship. It didn't let me click the ship. It's not that my mouse is broken, since it let me click to continue some dialogue at hte VERY beginning.Probably just me though."
"I can see where people are coming from regarding the P2W, and sure, if you want to get anywhere even close to the top of the leaderboards, you gotta spend a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money, but that's because the game has been around  for years and players have dedicated their lives to being on top since day one, so, even on top of spending 1000+ on the game, chances are you'll never be on top.However, starting out, I have been a player since the beta opened, years ago, and have one of the lowest IDs I've seen so far. (About 97000 rn, most players are in the 10 millions) and I stopped playing for the longest time, and when I returned a month or two ago, I had no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ I was doing, I was a level like 6 or something, through hard work and dedication, (Not spending ANY MONEY, I am a level 36, you just have to have patience, and the will to play. Only thing I warn you, you have to be prepared to lose. You're going to be attacked, sure you'll lose your fleets, that's life. There will always be someone bigger then you."
"If you have to have things now do not play this game!I started playing maybe a year ago and then quit. Since I quit the game has been significantly re-balanced. It is fun, engaging and challenging. The repair times and build times are in the days. So, do not expect this game to hold your attention for more than 30-40 mins at a time. It is a great - log in do something and log back out game. The commerce module lets you gain coins every-time you collect from it. It gets pretty significant after awhile and allows you to play for free and enjoy premium features. Expect to spend months getting up to speed with ships and things. The journey is fun imo. So I enjoy setting something to build for days at a time and slowly amassing a powerful fleet. Ships never die they just have to be repaired. It is the only game I can find that has Strategic and tactical space battles that you control that is a MMO."
"if you want to be #1 , then it's a pay to play .... if you remember it's a game , it's a blast ,,,,the instant repair Rancor Battleships  and Broad Sword Destroyers are a fun , period ( check U-tube for builds )There are several U-tube channels on this game for helpful ideas on ship builds ,,,,, Kixeye will change the game to balance it up when 1 weapon or ship type is being used by majority of players ( as an exploit is found ) and why the negative comments are  from mostly ""coiners"" or newbies ....Slowly the build times on ships are comming down , just a fact of the game ( hopefully some nerfs for bases coming soon as they are weak VS ship attacks with Nerf of Destroyers ) Level 35 to 39 bases ,,,  expect your Base to get uninvited guest  :) ,,,,,The game has changed a lot since the introduction of Carriers for fleets and Crafting to up grade the ships ( part of the evolution of the game )and there always seems to be  a new race for ""new""  ship types/ classes  in the pipe lineSo over all , this is a fun game if you are willing to invest some time"
"Amazingly fun and addictive.I quickly fell in love with this game, as it has some of the following.Pro's:A no-loss system. You dont really lose much if you are wiped out.No need to make more ships, just repair the blown up ones and you are good to go.Lots of different loadouts for shipsSpace carriers. Mmmmmm.Alliance system.CoC like base raiding system, with a good bit of strategy involved.Noob protection is VERY good.Translator for many launguages.Semi-Good CommunityMultiplatform (Phone, computer, tablet, ect)Can use structures that are being upgraded, to a certain extent.Cons:Upgrade and building time can be a bit extreme at times.Several little hangups that some alliances use.Attack and defence system needs a group attack like system.Corvettes serve almost no purpose after very early levels.Fighters and carriers need to be MUCH more easy to get.Otherwise this game is amazing. LOVE IT."
first time i played it really enjoyed it im level 8 i tried my first attack on a city we got along as buds right after the only pay to win methods i see here is just speed building. why people complain about that is beyond me as they are so terrified of your skills as a player that they have to pay hard earned cash just to kill you XD even if you die your buildings will repair as if ntohing happened if they greif you enough talk in forums :pwould kill a city to make friends again 10/10
Its just an awesome and fair game! There is NO pay2win!!!! You just can buy ressources that are easy to farm and buy modules that you can craft at your own at moderate time!!!!so shut up stupid haters!
I play this game good but it hangs up when I play with all upgrades now it does not play even when it told me to sign in on my steam account it doesn't show what it is doing. its like it play by it self and when I exit can't play the other games
"I loved this game, it was one of those few space games where you could make your own fleet but the updates and rebalances have broken the game (ship hit points are now equal to repair time! making tankly ship builds useless, unless you fancied waiting forever) your ship could have the most powerful weapons and upgrades in the game and it could take less than 5 mins to repair (which is free) or it could have the worst weapons and kit in the game but have a ton of health but take days to repair?! wtf dev's? bring back the old repair system which was actually based on how good idiviually (sorry for poor grammer) components were. finally, about the game being pay to win, it really isn't ive only brought a small pack of cash in-game to buy the stucture that makes more in-game cash, so yes buying in-game cash is useful for that reason but it isnt necessary to actually be good at it, the game is fairly balanced so you wont be attacked by exetremely difficult enemies, plus provided your with a decent alliance they'll back you up. its a great game, just get rid of the new update!"
"I played for free for a long time and have enjoyed all the changes and updates, once they moved to steam I gladly contributed cash for increased game play and to maximize the effectiveness of my fleets.  Made great friends and brought existing ones to the game..  Keep up the good work.  We love vega!"
"I acualy like this game,its fun,hard and the grind is 24/7 if you dont grind you cant grow and you wont go any further.i see a lot of ""its pay to win"" there is a way to go around that just dont pay if you dont want to and if you want to pay go ahead!"
"The reviews of this game being pay to win are highly exaggerated, I have played this game on both mobile and PC (explaining my low Steam hours). The reason people have a problem is because of the Commerce Module, a building you can get for your base, by paying maybe 5$ or maybe referring people who pay money. After that, you have a slow, 3 coins / day income, which can be boosted after you spend many of those. The fact of the matter is, people aren't necessarily throwing hundreds of dollars at Kixeye like you may think.That doesn't mean those people don't exist. They always exist. Just don't go whining about it because theres always going to be that guy no matter what you're doing.+The events are tough, and until around 20+ require almost 24/7 farming to get anything, which is fine considering most of the blueprints given out are meant for higher level players, looking for something with a little more edge against other players and possibly NPC fleets.+NPC fleets, quite possibly my favorite part of this game. I don't have to provoke other players in the game to get loot and have a nice battle every so often. The AIs on the NPCs aren't bad at all, although it isn't like fighting an another player, its still interesting to fight them.+Now, if you've heard this game is like Clash of Clans in space, they're wrong. Theres no troop spam, or luck of the AI. 1-6 ships, versus 1-6 ships, or 1-6 ships versus a fortified stronghold. And if you don't like how your ships are moving in auto battle mode, you can take full control, set strafe and forward movement waypoints, targets for multiple ships, and you can choose what weapons, armor, and damage type resistant shields you have. I much prefer the more in depth combat in Vega Conflict than spamming down Archers and Barbarians in C.o.C.+Of course theres always, ""Well can't the higher level enemies attack me?"" No son, those level 60 fleets won't be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your level 10 base. There is a 6 level range (up and down) that you can't attack or be attacked outside of. NPCs attacking you, which generally doesn't happen outside of certain events and higher levels, although you can attack any level NPC fleet.I won't call this the Patron Saint of all base-building strategy games though, there are always downsides. Past this point, are the downsides.-Once in a while, there will be an event, where a special blueprint is given out. This blueprint is special because, it is now a meta. No, Kixeye isn't the best at weapons balancing. Of course theres always the opposite of the spectrum (Which happens much more often in my opinion), when all the given blueprints are absolute sh!te and people only get them because they can.-Build times, yes the dreaded build time. Not only do you have to wait days for buildings to upgrade, but fleets may get lengthy repair times as well. fortunately, as you progress you get more fleets, but it isn't always enough. It starts to get pretty bad when you reach teir 2 ships.=Did you know this game has a story? Yeah, me neither until about 2 months ago. Most events come with a tid bit of story that you get to read in the form of a transmission, or a video if you feel like it. This is a neutral point, It gives the game a little bit of extra flair, although the game would be just fine with out it.This was my opinion, supplimented with a good few facts about your game if you actually took the time to read this long♥♥♥♥♥review.All in all, I have to give this game,8/10It may seem farmy after a while, but I think its definetly worth at least trying."
"Fun, very well put together, endless gameplay. Cons: It can take days to move an inch in this game is the way I would put it. If you get crazy and try to collect a bunch of resources with most of your fleets, or fight other fleets, suddenly they will all be damaged 100%, 50 if you're lucky, and it will take days and resources to get them back in fighting shape.  It takes days and days and months to build up your base and/or upgrade it. Everything takes days! only complaint."
Great game to pick up and play on any platform. Lots of people ♥♥♥♥♥ because they're adapting it to allow newer players to have a chance against veterans but I like the direction it's going. Highly recommend.
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH. i used to play it on ipad but i want crazy when i found it on computer. btw the gameplay and art style is very good and i think the developers should work hard on it.
"This games takes effort and time. But you can speed the progress you have in the game by microtransactions which I dont, Its a nice free to play online game. But becomes really annoying when you dont have the time but want to progress further in the game fastly. Try it if you got the patience but its definitely worth a try. There are not much noticable bugs in the game."
"Fun game possibly one of my favorite ""city building games"" i have plaid. AND ITS ON PC AND MOBILE! i am having trouble getting my computers account on my phone tho so i will have to see about that not upsetting me but i would like to be able to have the same base on both devices and also may be spending a bit of money on this game over time i cant wait. ""some ideas for the game. let players leave alliences when they wantinstead of having to have to wait. Maybe add more ships in the futur. idk how many there are since currently atm i only have a lvl 10 base as of right now but im guessing there is a ton more. Thanks for the Wonderful game! See yall soon!"
"This is a very good game. You have a base and you attack other planets. A space version of clash of clans and it is a totally free game. I havn't played that long on this game but its a good game, I would recommend it."
"as a beta tester i played this game since it was in beta test mode way before it become public now since it came on to steam it is alot easier to access its a brill game and i have spent alot of time and coin in this game and i have always been a big supporter in kixeye games now i have linked my original game to this i find all my games in 1 place....i would recommend this game to anyone..and i have and now there is over 300 of my work mates, friends and family play this. keep up the good work kixeye"
"Amazing strategy game that works on multiple platforms. It might look like your standard base builder game where you upgrade you modules and build armies. But Vega Conflict lets you control and costumize every unit (ship) to counter the strategy of others. Instead of a cruiser vs cruiser ending in a draw, the cruiser with the better fit can still lose if the other cruiser is controlled better.The game has a very interesting blueprint mechanic that lets you get rare modules and ships from the AI controlled ships you attack. And the pvp has some very cool depth that really relies on strategy and skill.Unfortunately the game still has pay to win in the form of coins that lets you instantly complete something, but the fun is that you can actually punish people for it by attack them :D"
"Quite interesting base building game.If you are familiar to Clash of Clans, then you will love this one, it's a bit more complex.You get to build your base and choose who you want to attack, with the fleet which you personalized.You get a general map of the people surrounding you which leaves you with the feeling of owning abit of space in the map.Theres alliances, 1v1 fights, and the pvp itself seems to be skill related.Def a must try."
"I am loving it, easy to pick up and i can link my account to my phone so i can play when i am not home. great game, play it, love it.I think it would be a bit better if they would add another fleet deck, or allow you to repair ships while the deck is upgrading.allowing more then one build, or upgrade at a time would be nice."
"I'd have to say that I can agree with people saying this game could be pay to win.  It's very easy to pay your way to power.  However, if you have the patience and time, you can get powerful with no problem.  I find the game has a good balance with the time it takes to do the upgrades and everything.  So far I have enjoyed every hour I have put into this game and will be putting more hours into it.  I would recommend at the very least trying this game to see if it fits with your playstyle."
Steam payments are slow to go thru. When i pay i need it now not in few hours or next day or 2 days from now. I make the paymnet to use it right now. Other wise i'd wait and not pay anything.
"I really enjoy the game, though it is mostly only fun for the first while.Pros:+Great sounds & graphics+Interesting mechanics+Large number of each type of equipment from ships to weapons to armours+PVE is very funCons:-Pay2Win-Long repair times for ships-Only one fleet can be repaired at a time-Long waiting times for simple things-Only one base module can be upgraded, modified, or used at a time (I.E. five days to upgrade the Fleet Bay, nothing else can be upgraded until it has completed)-PVP is basically just attacking down -- While there is a 5-level limit to attacking other players, it is fairly easy to create a decently powerful fleet at a low enough level to attach most any other player, whom then are unable to retaliate outside of immediate self-defence-PVP against bases mostly comes down out-ranging the enemy as much as possibleQuite fun, but as to be expected from a free to play mobile game, it only gets harder, slower, and less fun the longer one goes without spending money. However, despite this the game is still some fun and is worth checking out.If the repair times on damaged ships were less extreme, I would be much less reluctant to give VEGA Conflict a recommendation."
i have played this game for 2 years. i have shared game with other friends that have also started playing the game. i would say that i dont take thhis game as serious as most. i play every day and i coin occasionally. you can reach the high levels if you are patient and make friends in game. the important thing to remember is its a game produced by a business that makes games. theyre here to make money. its their product. theres the free way and the paid way. neither is bad imo. i do both. cheers see you in game
"Solid Time Waster. Thats all this game is.Speaking of DLC content and COINS...CONTENT IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE... Think of it this way. Kixeye is a shady used-car dealership, with their shady salesmen, they sell you garbage hyping it up beyond belief. In the end, you just paid the full price of a brand new Ferrari and got a beat up used Honda with 200k on it, and it needs new tires.I'd rather spend money to buy the Dragon Lore AWP skin in CS:GO, than spend any money in this game."
"I find this to be a very enjoyable game overall and I would recommend it.  I was big fan of RTS games before becoming a predominantly console gamer.  I tried a few mobile games (Boom Beach, Clash of Clans, etc) but found there was nothing ""Real-time"" about it.  Enter Vega Conflict, a game which I originally found on my phone.  I took a liking to this game due to the fact that the combat was in actual real-time, not like other games where you can only choose where to attack (and possibly redirect them slightly).  There is a lot of depth to the combat in this game, with many different ship classes, weapons, shields, and upgrades to choose from to customize your fleet.  Fleet size is limited, which I feel helps with fleet diversity and forces players to fly their ships with some skill, rather than the smash my army against your army mechanics that many RTS devolve into.  The game features monthly events that provide new technology and ship types if you are able to kill a large number of computer enemy fleets.  This game is also a social experience, as I'm sure most MMO-esque are. With all of that said, no game is perfect, and this one has some flaws.This is a free-to-play game that leans on timers; that is, you can either use your purchased ""coins"" to speed up processes (building ships, repairing ships, building your base, etc) or wait out those processess out for free.  This can create some instances where you are facing an opponent who will spend his real-world money to continually repair his ships to attack and defeat you, regardless of your respective skill levels.  The monthly events are geared toward high-end players who have been playing the game for a long time; as a newer to mid-level player, there isn't very much for you to do during these.Overall, my experience with this game has been more good than bad and I recommend RTS fans give it a try."
"I highly recommend this game due to its intense action and strategic gameplay...Though this game is a few years old...it is still fun...and itâ€™s free!!....This game might be a pay to play game if your impatient..but if your patient enough...this is the game fore you....Action,Strategy,and many Players!!! Conquer the Void"
"Great game so far!If you're interested in joining use my SPECIAL invite code: 1430d06It might be just a regular invite code ;-)It's your typical cash shop builder game but based in space. I havent spent money yet, but I wouldnt count it out in the near future.Lots of depth compared to games like this."
Great game a few quirks that could use some fixing but overall a great f2f/p2p. game can be frustrating at times so give it time because your gonna have to make time for ups and what not... battles are fun and can be AI controlled to ease of repeat  playing. 4.25/5
I have played since beta. 3 planets .Now over 120 sectors 9 planets in each . It has changed a lot . Its free to play .pay to win . but still worth trying . get in with older players and grow . kill bases and fleets . fly your fleets vs other players .Us stratigy to stay alive .
"i dont know what is wrong with all the losers saying its a major pay-to-win game, because it honestly really is NOT a pay-to-win game. i have played it for a while now and its a fun game to play, the people who say its bad and its a only pay-to-win game are just impatient losers with no experince of a wide variety of gameplay choices, SO get a real life and realise how extremely well-worked this game is.A must play game.NOT A PAY-TO-WIN GAMEIT IS JUST A FAST GAME IF YOU PAY"
"I like the game because it is very challenging. You build and grow your fleets of ships as you want. What I don't like, The process in building with wait times is very long. The coining to build is a option that you control. This game is fun!"
Very fun until the new weapons and ships came out. Made every other class of ships almost useless. I used to play this game all night but for some reason it no longer works for my computer. It crashes a lot now when it never did before on this very same computer. no updates or anything and it just started crashing.
"Love this game, but at the same time im still not a high level so im not effected by the p2w yet lol probably will be changing this to a negative in the future from what ive seen in the other reviews"
It a fun  game you can battle agaenst other players while building up your forces the best way to get you resues is to raid them from vega but be waring if you not preped in this game other human players will raid  you base and there a lot of sectors and planets.The only disadvage is the time it takes for reseach and devlopment along with fleet repiered
only thing is yes coin is not a bad thing if you only get the thing that produces the coins. after that let it collect up as much as possible. so you can fix your ships faster. it is fun but also there are some that will devistate you thinking it is fun. but it is fun in general 
"game is allright, its somewhat like clash of clans, except its in space and 80% of the time your raiding cargo ships for resources, and only every now and then raiding other peoples bases. Wish there was a trade option for factions other than just a help option that drops time on your build or upgrade process by like 2% maybe. Anyway other than that its a allright game. nice building and refining for your base part makes you have to be somewhat active in it since astroids that spawn around your base actually run out and you have to move your mineral and Helium mining stations to make credits. Also another thing that sucks about the game is if your in a faction you cant see what your teammates base has or help there fleets in battle which to me kinda sucks. other than that I give this game a 2/5. I would still recommend that game for people who dont mind slow paced building and raiding ai cargo ships for most of the game."
"Great Game 5 Star to meYou may run into alot of bad reviews after the rebalance mainly because people hate change and like it there way dont pay them any attention they still play till this day.ever played Clash of Clans well you will love some Hand to Hand Combat lol metaphor speaking, no random selected bases to fight someone gets on your nerves or talks to much cyber junk , then pay them a visit with a Destroyer and blow there base to pieces and if you catch them flying around the sector fight like men lol.Download it get into the Action how fast you lvl depends on your hustle and commitment  but Coins help dont be a slacker get some coins ... you will need them plus if you will pay for Madden 2016 then you can spend 5 dollars on a commerce module all the smart players have them!!!! all the complainers dont lol"
Fun game. I beta tested it's original release came back to see how game is fairing a lot has changed. Is a great strategy game a lot to do. Lots of customization. But like a lot of kixeye games its expensive to compete at the top
"It's a good game, but start it up by being realistic.It's free to play, but the company needs to make money, the people need to eat, pay their mortgage, and dress their kids for school.  They need money somehow.The standard for F2P games is to limit expansion by time, and then they let you buy out of that time by spending money. Vega is no different.  It's not pay to win, but it's definitely play more if you pay.Development of buildings, tech, ships, etc all start out quick but eventally take days.  Your first few weeks you won't even notice the time restrictions.  Buildings and tech only takes a few minutes.  Cheaper, smaller, ships repair instantly for free.But as you progress, you'll find that one tech can take a week to research, but before you start you need to spend 5 days upgrading a building, and then after you're done researching you'll spend five days building the ship you just researched.    Oh, and you need six of those ships to build a useful fleet.All of which can be avoided if you spend money, of course.  But it's not pay to win, it's just a quicker experience if you pay.  Everybody, coiners and not, are playing the same game.If you do play, search on youtube for strategies, read the in game chat, and if you value your ships don't steal resources."
"played this game for a long time, stopped for a while but have picked it up again a few days ago. Graphics are great for their scale and runs very smoothly. Gameplay is very immersive and I have to admit, I got addicted to this game at one time!I am glad I chose this game and would recommend it to others if they are looking for a game like this."
"While it takes a long time to get to an end-game level, the game mechanics at their core are very fun and rewarding to figure out and ultimately master. Completely taking down your first real enemy player fleet feels the absolute best.It's a free to play game, meaning of course it encourages microtransactions to jump ahead a bit. In the end, however, skill is all that matters. If you can't fly your fleet right, no amount of cash will prevent someone from shutting you down.Being a multiplayer platform, there's also a lot of behind the scenes back-stabbing and under the table deals that can arise between the numerous alliances that are out there. Battle brothers band together, huge sector-wide wars are fought...At the heart of it all, though, is the VEGA Corporation. Join us Rebel.Take.Them.Down."
"I recommend this game if you're light hearted and just want to play a fun space-based game where you control multiple fleets of ships and do spacey stuff :D However, if you plan on playing this game professionally, be ready to spend more money than Donald Trump's father loans him as the constant stream of new content makes it rather difficult to keep on top of the PvP game as one month you have the best ships, etc, then the following month those ships are just as effective as the voyager corvette           (First ship).(To the Devs)Cool idea, in my opinion, could you make it so that you can queue up fleet repairs so that players don't have to keep logging on to make sure each fleet is repaired? Its kinda annoying when its early morning and you keep yourself awake just to ensure you can start your next session with all your fleets ready to go."
"Product received for freeThis game in an amazing mix of singleplayer and multiplayer. with quests to guide you, (but not to control you!) you can get rewards in an open-world (or, in this case, open-universe!) gameplay. There are also alliances so you can play with others: friends, family, total strangers, whatever you want! One of the biggest parts of the game are events. Events reward you with improved technology, resources, new ships, and much, much, more. Overall, this game is a must-play, hope you enjoy playing VEGA Conflict!"
"Want to work hard or be casual? Play it for free. Want to speed through to medium lvls? Look for best coin deals. I have played this twice. First was on Facebook and I did not spend any coins. I only grinded and waited patiently for new lvls. I got tired of it, because my personal life needed more attention than usual.Now a year or two later I started again, but with a tactic in mind. I put only 15 euros in and got myself the golden struture which is only 300 coins, that generates coins based on the lvl of the structure. It helps with gameplay in a significant way. So this is kinda P2W game, but not in a negative manner. Coins only help to build and repair faster. Rest is up to the player to macro and micro manage structures and fleets. Most of all. Skill actually exist in this. And that skill is using ship builds and manueverings to outplay your opponents."
Awesome game! Cross platform too so I can keep up with my resources from my phone while I am afk. Awesome starter pack for entering code 10c5ef4 Play at: http://play.vegaconflict.com/ 
"VC is a good game. Let's get this out of the way - yes there in in game currency welcome to FTP. Unlike a lot of FTP games the coins really are not needed to progress. The place where they take their place is late end-game level players so new and mid level players can easily play with no money. The game offers a lot of space combat options in terms of building fleets, tactics to use them. There is base defense and attack. The social elemtns are well handled with alliances and a good chat system. The game is active and overall very helpful to new players."
"One of the better basebuiling games with a RTS starcraft-like arena or battle mechanic and also a PVP and PVE environment. It takes a lot of time to build anything or get a higher level. Play it casually, in-between your other games. So far, it's kept most of my interest constantly for 4 months now, and i spend more time on it than anyother games, albeit afk at times. I haven't spent a dime on this game and you have to get used to getting beaten on and outclassed by anyone that pays money. But I have thought about it, because the deals have looked pretty good. The ships are diverse and the weapons and additional modules are all quite different and quite interesting. For instance, the energy weapons are short range; they always hit, the missles are explosive with medium range, and the projectiles are long range but slow. All types of ships include: the  all-around cruisers, the weapon loaded battleships, the evasive harriers, the pursuiting cutters, and the sniping destroyers. Overall, not the best but a good game. You can quit anytime but I'm pretty sure it'll have a hold on you for awhiile."
"Great secondary game (due to time walls). Not really pay to win, just super grindy. Just about everything you can get on the store you can farm for.+Fun+Good Alliance mechanics+Great events+Good pvp/pve+Great customer support-Community can be toxicI give it a 8/10"
"Don't understand why people are so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about this game, it's the same thing as every other Kixeye game. New and more powerful items get released once in a while to keep people engaged and they have to be hard to get to keep the game alive. If the same items are the only thing that players can used, once people reach the end game stages, the game will die. You don't HAVE to spend money because you don't have to have every item. The game is about grinding, if thats not your thing, don't play it."
"i play it, i check in... then i check out... you know... its like any of those city defense games you play on your smart phone. they are all alike... why dont you join my guild? its called ESTpm and the reason its called that is because i'm eastern standard time and i play in the p.m hours....in-active players of 2 days gets booted though...no sense of having a guild if players arnt going to play. theres plenty of other guilds out there that dont care if you take long breaks"
people say that the game is expensive and crap but even though there playing the game right now and have over 500 hours on the game. thats just being a giant idoit if you have more than 500 hours on the game that you hate.but still its free and its kindy fun too me .
"A great game. 9 out of 10.I have  played vega on my iphone for over 1 year, its amazing.The most important thing is, the developer is very creative, keeps releasing awesome new contents. Its an all-around game, very fun and very time consuing."
"Okay to theres a fe things you need to to kno before you get into Vega Conflict 1) Its a mobile and PC platform, pc being the easiet to battle other players on, however as you'd assume with a mobile game, many of the features to develop your ships and tech up require time unless you put a lot of money into the game. If you're looking for a game that you can get to the top quickly in easily then this is not the game for you. HOWEVER, the community and the players are virtually all fantastic, and I promise that if you find a group of people in game to play with that you'll have a great time."
its a briliant game and yes its very pay to win but its very expensive to do so its very fun if you are a patiant stratagists with lots of loadouts and ships with an array ofenemy NPCs aliances are extreemly helpfull but public chat can get very toxic in certan area sector 600 is a nice helpfull one ive main played this on mobile but its good on pc too
"I played this game for 20 minutes as part of a First Impressions series I do for my YouTube channel of free games on Steam...and I didn't even need 20 minutes to know exactly what kind of game this is.It's the kind of game that relies on you infesting time in to it to build up a good base and great ships...only to have somebody higher up than you destroy it all. This makes you want to get as high as them...and so you need to put more time in to it. Coming back for days and days to collect resources, waiting for days for ships to build and base components to finish upgrading...the higher up you want to go, the longer you have to wait until you're starved for content...and then it offers you the ability to use real money to instantly finish all your projects. So now you have a choice: either wait for possibly weeks for all your stuff to finish unlocking, building and upgrading and not really be able to do anything during that time...or pay money. You lose your ships in a battle and need to repair? That might take a long time...unless you pay money.It reminds me of some other nearly identical game on Facebook that did this exact same thing and that I actually liked until I realized what it was doing.Not sure if pay to win exactly because im not going to be playing this game long enough to see the difference...but certainly pay to enjoy."
"It's an absolutely amazing game. By the way, I'm a bounty hunter in this game, I get paid coins from my alliance leader or other players to decimate player bases and fleets. Not to mention that I'm addicted to it, and sure it can be pay to play AT TIMES. Hell, I'd say that the only, ONLY DLC that's worth it was the Exodus Pack for $10 and the coins are not worth your money what-so-ever. Pretty time consuming, but nonetheless... REALLY ENJOYABLE. And for the people who b**** about this game being pay to play... SHUT THE F*** UP, GET GOOD AND BE ON MY LEVEL. Sorry, but yeah within 23 hours, I've went from level 1 to 29 at warp speed (get it... SPACE JOKES. XD Uh... that's your que to laugh... fine). And there was no need to spend a ton so I can hardly call this pay to play. I'll probably be playing this everyday for the next 2 years because I'M ADDICTED (SAVE ME... jk). Oh, thanks for the Berserker Carrier and Void Pulse Cannon IV for no reason 'cause I'm too much of a noob to use it yet, 19 million Helium-3 and 6 million Mineral Ore to install the cannon... ASK ME AGAIN WHEN I'M 90 YEARS OLD, BUDDY.10/10 ............................................... WOULD VEGA AGAIN................."
This gane is really easy to get in to and great fun if you find a good clan Remember to use the shop to get better weapons just for the start and if you want to pay some cash for coin i did and i dont regeat it one bit

Good gameplay Good Graphics Good Quality lots of ships to get lots of structures to build lots of choices to make i would rate this 10/10 strategy game even the combat is good recommended for strategy game lovers
"The game to a non coiner is a slow go if your just starting. and you can only gain the new stuff if you coing to get the ships, weapons, and the mecks that you need to make a good fighting ship.  Its a good game just to play if you get bored. but if you dont have money its a strugle."
"As you can tell by the reviews, we all hate this game, but we can't stop playing it.Edit on 6-30-17: As this game goes more and more pay-to-win, with no ability to compete under $1,000 a year, I have changed my recommendation. Whales can completely stop your ability to play, and no good coin deals exist above the $5 commerce module. They have also introduced carrier upgrades that can only be bought (in theory you can do it without paying, but it doesn't happen in practice).This free-to-play game's ""energy system"" is repair time, and it has gotten up to roughly one day per lost battle.Wonderful game, shame it was ruined by the company."
"2 years playing and still  A ♥♥♥♥ING P2W , FARM FARM FARM ,EVENTS ? FARM AND COIN AND FARM AND COIN, THAT IN EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVENT, RIDICULOUS GUNS  SHIPS , AND COINS COINS FARM FARM , P2W"
This game started with such great promise and potential. But nowadays it is very slow to play with paying to play. The game has increased in difficulty quite alarmingly and is on an increasing trend unfortunately.
i have been playing this game for a long time now.. since way before steam and unity.. i do play this on kixeye.. i am a beta tester.. i love how the game has evolved of the years from just being a 6 sector game now its more fun having a ton of sectors to jump to and more sectors hopefully on their way cause its a alot better game than most out there and the best ship was the rancor... Man i feel old in this game with tons of new players. also there were no such thing as clans back when i started and now their are loads when clans first came out i joined my sector home team the 600united. and we done alot of sector racing between worm hole using the corvette just to see if any of us would get killed most of the time it was lucky if we got past sector 200 cause thats where scum and icu were based at times before more sectors came out now anyone very rare to see any of the origanal icu and scum players on.........its a brill game for all if you don't mind getting hit alot or you like to kill a few so come on in and join the fun
This game has turned into a big mess!Note: Just one year ago I wrote a positive review! Now everything changed! So stay away any game says free to play! All of them will fail eventually!
"if you have 1000 dollars just laying around every month, then this game is for you. if you dont have that then i have a message for you from the developers of this game (Kixeye)Kixeye: Fooooookk you. no money? okey, then you will not have fun! BWAHAHAHAH"
"As a Beta tester on this game i thought it was going to be a lot better than the normal space games,possibly with more things to do but all the feed back and idea's i put forward never got taken seriously and the game has stayed much the same as it was in the beta just with more ships and a new game engine.If your after playing a 4X game then really you need to look elsewhere but if your looking forward to playing with thousands of players then jump in and hold on tight as it has a steep learning curve once you get to level 30+ Pro's= Great Graphics and game play           Good amount of fleets to build and upgrade           Massive player base           Easy to play but hard to master Con's= If you want the best fleets then expect to pay hundreds of pounds for a fleet loadout with weapons and Gold            Don't expect the same fight twice its know got an Ai fleet control option that sucks and the damage dealt by the                   Vega fleets is way above yours.Some players are just there to cause you hassle as they are bored with the game but kixeye is quick to boot them off,So far this game gets a 7/10 as its not 100% finished and its being updated with new content so not possible for me to comment on the expensive fleets or their power or the new weapons"
"I've seen people saying a lot of what I’m about to say in the reviews, but I thought I'd contribute anyway. Although I have only played 3 hours of this game through steam, I have been playing on mobile for the last 2 weeks off and on every day. This brings me to the fact that you can play this game on mobile, as well as on PC, which is in my opinion a nice touch. Vega Conflict is a free to play, MMO space sim with RTS elements and base management. It's gameplay consists of building a base that will withstand any assaults from enemy fleets, as well as building up your own fleets to attack other players bases. You gain resources by attacking other people’s bases, attacking NPC cargo or military fleets, or through stealing cargo from other players' recently defeated NPC fleets. Base upgrades, research for new weapons, and building new ships take real time. At first, as it is with all F2P games, the wait is quick, and is softened even further by the fact that you can skip the build/research time of any process that is under 5 minutes. Your base expands quickly, as all of the build times are under 5 minutes and you can complete many upgrades in the first few hours of play instantly, with no wait at all. However, over time, the average wait time starts to increase, and eventually reaches the point where at a base level of 25, you are waiting multiple days for a building to upgrade. Due to the fact that there are multiple buildings to upgrade, each of which have multiple levels, all of which take 2 days or more to upgrade, it can get very tedious very quickly as you can only upgrade one building at a time. Micro transactions are present, however you can get almost anything present in the game for free, over a very long amount of time. For example, if you want to speed up the researching of a new technology, the building of a ship, or the refitting of a building with new weapons and armor, you can either wait the allotted amount of time, or you can pay for premium currency and skip the wait. Overall, it's a fun experience. If you get involved with the ""alliance"" feature, it can build a sense of community within a game that would otherwise have none. However, I can see that as the wait times increase, I will become less and less tolerant, making it a game for which I can see the end of its relevance approaching very quickly. Give it a try, but know that it’s a free to play, and get ready to wait.EDIT:They have updated the game and increased the afformentioned wait times by around 6 times the original ammounts. I am changing my review from positive to negative untill they fix the problems that they have created in their latest update. Please do not spend any money on this game untill the update is either rolled back or fixed in some way.EDIT 2:Changed back to positive, seeing that there are workarounds to the increased wait times.EDIT 3: Run."
"Spend a lot of time while it was still on facebook and liked it from the beginning but.....recent marketing strategy made game highly real-money dependent if you want to stay relevant.If you have a lot of time to spend (or money for that matter), go for the game. + Deep customization possibilites for every ship (weapons, weapon supports, shields, armor, resistance generators, fighters, effect fields) and base setups (positioning matters!)+ Graphic quality is very good for ""free"" game.- Exponentially growing wait time for anything in the game.- Events that are tuned only for the first ~2% of the community.- Relatively low pvp FFA ceiling that forces every lower level player to under-equip base/ships to avoid crushing attacks from top players.If you enjoy neverending grinding, i can recommend it for you. Otherwise, not even worth to start."
"Over al its not a bad game to play. granted there s a bit of a learning curve after a point but thats why finding a good clan comes in handy at. it does follow a more realistic way just like what woul most likely happen when te human race gets to that point. the tech is ever advancing so there is always somthing new to get and fight with. yes you can buy alot of stuff in the game that can give you the edge in battle but true skills can overcome some of the biggest of spenders without you spending so much in return. its a great game to kill time rather your on a PC or moble,"

"I like the people who play, and their optimism for the game, bu the gameplay is a cross between WoW's current P2W situation, EA's crap, and Pseudo Starcraftish, only you can ONLY do one thing in each queue category. It doesnt matter if you have all the resources in the world. VC's Timer situation is not helped by the mini boosts you can get either free or with the non-buyable in-game currency (as well as the buyable), as the booster you gt for free may be ill timed. That's right.Need a 12 hour Ship Refit token, and were given a free 1 hour ship build token instead? Don't worry, it only takes 3 DAYS to re-equip that one thing to your Dominion Carrier. I'm sure youll find a token you might handy... A module Upgrade boost token that expires this time tomorrow? Thanks for nothing Kixeye. I need to upgrade that same building, used for both refitting and virgin shipbuilding, but I have to wait 3 DAYS."
"The game is become an absolute joke, I played it since the beginning and since paul preece took over the game dynamics it has a massive advantage if you buy constantly updated tech only to find it is outdated by the time you spend 6-8 weeks building a current fleet to be relevant. The tech you buy is constantly been nerfed so your money has been completely wasted. You have to grind for hours and hours if you don't have the right tech to do the events which has also become repetitive every couple of days now and you are overspammed with so much tech and mark upgrades, you will never ever have enough unless you spend your hard earned cash. It is full of broken promises and kixeye are full of constant lies. It has got to the end where the game is about to crash and burn so the company has give so much power in the game to coiners its a clear money grab because they know its broken and unsavable. if you play do not put money into it because in a few months this game is likely to collapse on itself. Its not a wargame anymore, its a farming game where you grind for 3-4 days to get ships, 7-14 days to build 1 each, 2 months getting its upgrades and that is per ship not per fleet. to conclude, its a money grab, unbalanced, made up of lies and a complete money grab."
"Game got old, if things dont change soon for the player base it will dieits a coinfest, balance is tottaly gone with new xeno devision, free to play people need to stay under lvl 55 fleets to even remotly enjoy FVF...game is♥♥♥♥♥♥in current state, if you reead this and wanted to download it, come back in a year when either the game is better or tottaly gone, you dont know what you are missing, because there is nothing to misss.......#rip frigates"
Ok this is not a bad game at all it is really kinda good other then the pay to win part welll kinda pay to win any way i don't like how long it takes to upgrade stuff it kinda makes it wear i really don't wan't to play and the game well if you really wan't to get to like level 40 well have fun wasting 2 years of your life it is a good game but i just don't like wating 1day for one thing and then 1 more day for the other thing for you can build a ship then it kinda takes very very long to repair a good ship that is not♥♥♥♥♥♥and other then all that the game is very good!

"The game is basically a company taking everyone for a ride and they are all sat sipping gin and juice laughing at all the gullible gamers playing it! Well done Kixeye great business model and well done for making millions outta these people I am sure you feel proud of yourselves.But, if you like having a big fat practical joke played on you over and over again by a money grabbing company that is only interested in gullible gamers that get addicted to repetitive processes then this is the game for you!All you have to do is work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to work your butt off by waisting more time than you have, and money, to get the latest ships and upgrades… well they were the latest 6 months ago so you have to…IF YOU READ ALL THIS THEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Just save yourself all the trouble and don't play this. It is not worth it.I may play this, but now the game's gone down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Unless you have an extra $10,000 to spend on anything you want. Well if you have that much money give it to me. After than then spend the money. No still don't, it would just enable the company (kixeye) to suck more money out of the players and make the game more P2W. If you want to have any chance of compeating with anyone else already playing it will cost you way to much irl money. The power creep in this game is also huge. TL;DR Game has turned into p2w/p2p♥♥♥♥♥"
"100% Pay to win, and you win... NOTHING !Vega conflict is a base and fleet building game. Most game gurus tell us on numerous YOUTUBE spectacles this game is dead or soon to die...Base building is fun, but you wont protect it and it wil be demolished 100% on every try by an oponent. In the case of some damage you lose precious cargo whitch you needed to build everything, even if you demolish the entire attacking fleet...Max 6 Fleets consisting of 6 ships each are fun to build. But dont wait up for them to finish, as a new type of carier will take about 1 month to finish, unless you buy the parts,  building time and what more to have it and it will be obsolete bu the time you got it working...Cargo is obtained by attacking other base, fleets and the AI. All in all its a grind fest. However you will lose most of your efforts soon to another player that can take it easely from your underated base or  fleets.Silly events that are so repetive and damging to your base and fleets you cant imagin finsihing anything unless you buy  coins to speed up the repair of your fleets...Devs change the setting of all you bought, grinded and got for free with in a month. This wil force you to invest even the second morgage of your house to keep upGive up your day job to play this game so you can be raded when you take a little nap or even while you watch as you can do didle about it..Unless you wish to devote your entire fortune and never sleep again, dont play this garbage...However If you like all above, please try this fun game, as I need some new players to take advantage of !GL & HF !"
"Do not invest money into this game. Though it can be fun to try and defeat a greedy developer without spending cash, everything you invest in will become worthless in about a month when the next update comes out."
"I really enjoy this game. The upgrade times are long but that is typical for the genre, although one nice thing is that clan members can 'help' you and reduce your wait times by a pretty good amount. The clan's in this game are decent sized, and the events have been great. I have put over 100 hours in this game and have so much more stuff to do."
"I'm not even going to take the time to explain why this game is terrible. I used to enjoy it, but it's now a pay to win money pit. Play literally any other game, just please don't play this."
"I've clocked up a lot of hours in this game, I enjoy it - but this is despite the developer Kixeye's decisions most of the time. Their priority is income - they don't realise that player (therefore customer) goodwill should be first and foremost, as this is worth far more money to them than strategies designed to basically extort money from players and exploit players desire to ""keep up with the Joneses"".Player enjoyment and customer goodwill is what makes the most successful free to play games in the world work. Kixeye need to fix their attitude and change their priorities. It's a great game, but enjoyment of it is undermined with some regularity by the management."
"~-9.10.2017.Kixeye blew it. Don't play this game.~Well, I have YEARS of experience on this game, and I am still a F2P-er, the only time I actually spent money was because I really loved the game, and I still do, don't get me wrong, but I only put about 4.99 Euros to get myself something that makes money over time in the game.Now, the game is... rather difficult to say wether it's good or not, it really depends who you ask, and if you'd ask me, which of course you do then I'd say that this game is pretty good.Before we begin, let me start off by introducing you to the game. You're a miner that has worked for the VEGA Corporation (The ""Bad"" guys, I'll tell you why I put that in quotemarks later) but has now become a rebel due to you not getting paid enough, or no money at all. So, now you are a rebel, just like any other player, and you are working your way to the top by upgrading your base using resources that you gain from destroying other ships (other players may not always carry resources, if they do, then you get their resources if you destroy them), and by upgrading your modules, which are, by the way, the components of your base, you will get better technology to research, and once researched, you will be able to use it, and of course you're gonna want to use it (well actually there's little to no actually good rebel technology, I'll get into that later.) to destroy bigger fleets and the cycle repeats.Let me tell you about the factions, due to the fact that there are more than just these two.So, first off, you have the REBELS, which you are part of, you are against VEGA and the other factions except for one.The second one is the VSec (VEGA Security). They're basically much more powerful VEGA Fleets and they are WAY more brutal than the VEGA fleets and they oppose a great threat to you and the other faction you are allied with.The third one (And at the moment I am writing this, the last faction) is called the ISC, the Iron Star Company. They've been introduced by a guy named Larus, your ""drug dealer"", and they have allied with you. They're nice for the moment, and at the moment of writing this we are in peace with them.There is a lot of different tech to be earned due to the fact that the rebellion tech is just not good. The only things that are good are, ironically, high-end stuff, for example, the Kinetic Turret V, It takes a long time to reach it.But there are some gimmicks that really help you start, for example, the starter Scatter Missiles are really efficient and really powerful and a must-have when trying to advance.Just to clarify what I meant by putting ""Bad"" in quotemarks, I am currently really unsure if they're the bad ones, or the good ones, or wether the ISC is the bad or the good. By watching the story, which is presented through the messages of events, you can come to the same conclusion, but I don't force anyone. It's just my eternally revolving problem. (If you get that refference I'll give you a shekel. [[spoiler]It's from Celldweller's ""Lost In Time"" track[/spoiler]].Now, the game has a lot of good things and a lot of bad things about it, just like any other game.Let us start with the good things.GOOD THINGS The graphics are REALLY nice, and as I have played during the old days, I have seen how it evolved, and I am proud about it. The story is un-ending, and is continued with events, and the story is really nice. Definetely not the best, but amazing. Speaking of events, they're REALLY frequent, some so frequent that they start to become something bad, but I'll go into that later. The devs had this ideea to name ships based on what their class is on different things. For example, the ships of the Cutter class are named after snakes, the Rebel cutter is named the Taipan Cutter, the VEGA cutter is named the Gharial Cutter, the VSec one the Komodo, and the ISC one the Python. The Destroyers are named after ancient weapons. The Battleships are named after emotions. The Carriers are named after Viking mythology. The Cruisers are named after religion-related events and things. The Frigates are named after birds. And most importantly not really the Corvettes are named after human space-probes sent to space. It really took me some time to realise that. Speaking of nice things, you can actually play F2P, it's just gonna take a lot more time than P2P.BAD THINGS The game is REALLY grindy, it's grindy to the point of actually wasting months just to get new tech that you're gonna use to get even more tech that's gonna be EVEN GRINDIER to acquire. I am not exaggerating. Speaking of those frequent events, well, you see, each event has its really nice top prize, that being usually a really nice ship, and that nice ship ends up taking WEEKS to build. Yup, you heard me right, JUST ONE will take you WEEKS to build. Now, by the time you have about 2 ships done, this, assuming you're completely F2P, like me, there's gonna be another event with AN EVEN BETTER SHIP THAT THE LAST EVENT HAD, so basically, your 2 ships are obsolete now, and does it feel good? IT DOES NOT. Not one bit. I've been through it. These events also are usually REALLY grindy for mid-levels and low-levels, that's why low-levels usually shouldn't bother with events, but the mid-levels should since it's essential tech, and so do the high-levels. Now, why should high-level players do them? Aren't they the top of the food chain? Nope. High-End players are the ones. There's some differences, such as one having all the reserachable tech, several tiers of blueprints, and the other having almost, if not anything completely finished. Why are they grindy? Well, what if I told you that the events only last 4 Days? That might seem a nice ammount at first, but when you see how much loot (Event Points) you're gaining, you're gonna be in the ideea that most of us are, that only high-end players finish events. That is, of course, really not that true, but you're not unlike me, you're not someone who's willing to put 8 hours of your day into an event, repeating the same patterns for 8 hours, are you? Well, if you are, then mate, you're gonna be really successful. Kixeye is getting REALLY greedy, the last event had teased us with the Javelin Flagship, which is, in my opinion, pretty good, but oh would you look at that, 5 MILLION POINTS[/5]. Yeah. I am not even kidding. Why did they teaste us? Well, the event had a prize that they promised they'd give it once again that is really useful and a must-have, the Arrestor Beam. Well GG EZ because you can't bloody farm as much as having 5.5 mil points without spending either a lot of time in the game, or a lot of money in it. You decide. It's loose or loose harder. Some ships are really overpowered. I'm looking at the corvettes carriers, of course. If you don't have on e, then I am sorry to tell you that you will be outperformed by everyone who has one, and you will have to spend a lot more time farming. Let's say you have a fleet that can destroy level 40 VEGA fleets, let's say it's made out of 4 Venom Battleships and a Revelation Cruiser used as a tank. It's not instant-repair. Add a carrier, let's say, a Ragnarok Carrier. Guess what. You can now do level 40 VSec and up and, if you have the flying skills, you may even get a free instant repair. On a really serious note, the coining problem is getting out of hand. You that alliance  that is number 1? Yeah, it's been like that for almost forever. They're known for coining. Some of them have skill, and those are the ones that I respect, but a lot of them don't, and that's the bad thing. I-C-U is the top alliance because they coin like crazy. There's a lot more to be said, but I'll just end it here.Hope you enjoyed this."
"Kixeye have gone junkys for your coins i played this game almost 5 years , repairs and builds were managable up until last tech came around . you have to coin big now to have any quality time on it ."
"A lot of microtransation and this is mostly a pay to win game. If you chose to not pay for this game, you will have to do a lot of grinding. This include wait time that can take hours to get what you need to play this game.  Leveling up, get rescource, building ship and etc."
"Regular browserlike grindfest (5/10)It has nice graphics and AI is actualy great but once you have some levels every construction takes nice few realtime days. Refits, repairs and research at least only hours but there are no task queues. Mines are painfuly slow and pillaging recources takes lot of grinding.My advice is to give it a try but dont expect anything special"
well  it is not badbut you have to know that it will take ages to some kind of max out your baseand if you are at this point building new fleets will take agesbut if you see it as game you play over moths like a browser game you can actually have funi would recomend this game but suggest you have more games you can play next to it when building times limit your progress in vega conflict
"VEGA Conflict is an excellent war game of Strategy and Real-Time Player vs Player battles, this game brings unbelievable excitement I haven't experienced with an Real-Time Strategy for a very long time.However, alongside hearing that, you will also realize that the community of players is absolutely horrible. The players are very rude, and definitely will ruin your experience. And simply 'avoiding' players won't happen here as the game is literally focused on killing each other. Escaping is impossible.Alongside that, the company 'KIXEYE' who created the game is very money-hungry, enjoying the fact of earning a bunch of money off of mistaking people for 'good items' that aren't good and wasting a bunch of money.Do not play this game."
"plays game on phone: game disconnectsplays on PC and laptop: game still disconnectschanges connection: IT STILL DISCONNECTS!!Kixeye fix you're game man! it runs like my old computer up stairs and it runs on windows XP. i've only had this laptop for two days and it's running on Windows 10. I find it funny that i'm sitting near my internet rooter with full connection and little to nothing to show on your game for it, it's bad enought that you have to spend a bomb in order to get anywhere in this game but the connection is just bad.. very bad, your game isn't a problem it's a laughing stock to the user and your company, it's a joke just to play it.i've been playing the game for nearly 6 years and the fact your connect is still not working is just shocking, you make so meny updates yet you can't fix a simple problem but make ships longer to build and even longer to refit. unless you have friends playing this game it's pretty much flat out boring with nothing to do but gather blueprints but kixeye fix your connection becouse while you keep your connection like this i'll just keep calling it connection conflict. i play other games like this and i don't have any problems at all. forget about my connection, Kixeye you need to check your player base because it's dropping faster then destiny's player base, if anything i'm tired of playing this trash, im uninstalling it right now..."
"pretty cool game, long term gameplay...if you don't have a lot of time then maybe you are looking at the wrong game but if you think you got ample time then hit that download button and go to warp!...its war in space and you are just one person caught up in the middle of it, fully customiseable ships and bases with countless combinations for whatever task you are trying to adapt to will keep you busy for months and for some people years :)pay to win? im not sure about that as this is an early review i am writing but so far i havent needed to spend anything on the game...i havent seen anything that suggests you have to spend money on the game except one thing and only one thing... the commerce building that produces coins...which to me is a very smart investment as you only need to make a TINY payment for it...trust me i've spent more money on hotdogs than the cost of the commerce building and to be very fair i think the devs deserve the right to put at least something in the game that people would want to buy afterall the game is really fun the people in the game who are playing a super friendly, even people from different clans are friendly and helpful...what a community :Doverall rating gotta be a definete 7.5 out of 10...for a free game thats wicked awesome!... you still here!...downloard at warp speed now! engage! :'D"
forever changing end game. litterally impossible to keep up with the pace without spending money.($100's plus)you can atempt to keep up just enough to keep your head above water but thats all. not worth your time. at all. just like every kixeye game.
I played this game BEFORE it ever came on steam. In the begining it was fun the balance was some what there but still needed to be improved. Then in amater of 1 year maybe less it went completely to♥♥♥♥♥♥ They presented 6 - 10 events at the same time. Changed a lot of the aspect of the game for what reason? idk. In order to stay with the wave you have to spend loads of money just to survive from all the coiners.
"If you are playng or even thinking about playing Vega Conflict here is some information for you. My Advice is not to bother with this game. It used to be fun and fairly equal for all players, but has changed drastically over the years. Kixeye. the developers/owners of the game, have made the game just about unplayable for any but those who can afford to spend hundreds (or thousands) of dollars per month. They bring out new ships and technology at a rate that makes your ships and tech obsolete and nothing but junk before you can even build the stuff and use it unless you spend a ton to build it immediately for use. Any players that only use a bit of ""coin"" to play are left struggling to keep up and their stuff cannot even do more that minimal damage to your enemy. They have made the game practically un-playable by any but those that can afford to spend money in large quantities. For example, I purchased an upgraded package recently and within a week- before i could even get stuff built/refitted it was made obsolete by the release of a new faction of ships that eat all previous ships with ease. This is typical of Kixeyes policy for the last year or more.Vega Conflict is totally unbalanced, there is no need for flying skills anymore. All you need is a large amount of money and the willingness to be prepared to spend money to keep ahead of the other players. If you stop playing for 6 months, players that return have been ""given"" new ships and tech that look exciting and strong, but are made obsolete and practically USELESS before you even get a chance to use it."
"Developers will change the game rules every other month. Ships you spend weeks building will be useless with the new change. And if you spend money, you're even more screwed, because all that is useless after another month. HUGE power curve, almost impossible for new players to get ahead in the game."
"TL;DR I played this game since nearly the beginning, since before it was on Steam. It's a play to win game that is fun at first, but when you get to higher levels where a single upgrade takes over 10 days if you don't pay, or pay hundreds of dollars to pay for speed upgrades, etc. etc.  This game is perfect for people with lots of money, but little brains who want to feel powerful. Or maybe they don't have lots of money, and that's why they still rent a room in a crappy neighborhood, becuase they waste money on games like this.  It's a shame because it's one of the pay to win games that actually has fun game mechanics."
"It's clearly a p2w game. But nontheless, you can actually have fun without spending money by just staying in or under Tier 4/low 5. There skill actually matters and the ships you need aren't that hard to get.Just don't think you can play it all day and in top ranks, play it casually and you will have fun.EDIT: Don't even bother."
i have been playing this game over 3 years..... i would have recommanded this game to anyone and everyone.... now the events are way to hard and they have it to were if you pay you win now..... they are corrupt.... and only want you to pay!!! a level 35 destroyed a fleet that was a lvl 54.... there should be no reason why your health drops down to 60 percent reight.....? well no not with kikeye and vega conflict anymore.... :(
"This game definitely had a good place in my heart, but it requires too much game play and chatting time to have the best experience.... i don't like how the chat interface sucks on the android phones or tablets as it really takes away from chatting while not sitting at a computer... however!! it's really nice to have a cell phone / pc game that you can play anywhere"
"This is just a cheap mix of starcraft and boom beach, but with pointless complexity that does not make the game any more interesting. Another ""sit and watch"" style game.Also below it already has starter packs costing more than Destiny and it's content DLC's. That already raises red flags."
"this space game has great graphics , the base battles , the fleet battles , the updates , all of it has incredible potential and there are civil wars ! the pvp is amazing and can lead to entire sectors fighting each other for domonance of the region . . . .  But all that potential is hindered and NERFED totally by the lack of a ship refit module that allows players to refit existing ships while the ship factory is concentrated on building ships that take literally days and even over a week to build JUST ONE .  To put it bluntly , if you wanna pve the high lvl gear , or dominate the points in pvp , you have to pay money to win .  it would take you literally years to amass and Army of fleets to be able to do high scale pve and even more time making new ships specifically desinged for pvp .  it takes years to build alot of fleets , having just 7 to fill your fleet list is not enough , battles last no more than 5 mins and then you have the very very long repair times , some of the strongest ships can take over 20 hours to repair the fleet of 6 ships .  the game is amazing and it's difficult enough to ward away all novices , the game is harcore and when you get to endgame the elitism of the coiner factions is ENDLESS . THE COINERS COME IN GIGANTIC ZERGS .  so watch out don't attack powerful alliances even if they atck you or else as a noob  you can start crying your base is toast , and so are all those precious pvp medals you earned from destroying someone else's base ;) . So in conclusion , NO I WOULD NEVER RECCOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE . This game will have you ripping your hair out cursing kixeye time and time again , for showering the Coiners with all of the Legendary endgame pvp upgrades for money .  the amounts of farming you would have to do to refit all of your pvp ships with MK V Upgrades is beyond messure . MMos have don't stand a chance at the kind of farming you would have to do to get the best ships , ranked up to MK V in Vega . It is Not for the faint hearted and when all of your ships are destroyed , start crying or getting angry at kixeye . you better make a second account if you want to play hours on end farming the high end gear . to buy coins is a waste of you time , it costs insane amounts of money for a small amount of coins !!!! you have to Bill gates rich to afford every powerful pvp udgrade in the game  ( it's not even worth mentioning what it takes to grind the upgrades , consider it nearly impposible to get the MK v's in the quantity you need  )  "
"As a recently-retired VC player of 18 months, I figured I’d weigh in and give an honest review, using some of the app notes as a guide. Pour yourself a cup of space tea, because this is going to be lengthy.“Stake your claim, command your fleets, and wage epic war in space. Band together with other players in a bloody rebellion to take back the galaxy from the evil VEGA Federation.”This much at least is true: VEGA Conflict is a cross-platform MMORTS published by Kixeye. You build up a space base, construct fleets of ships from 5 different factions over weeks and months, and fight against either one of the VEGA Federation’s many branches and groups in PvE or against other players in PvP.Here’s the first major sticking point though: for all its marketing as a PvP-based game, the game mechanics themselves provide no incentive or benefit to attacking other player fleets. Sure, you can go and smash up your neighbour’s fleets and feel good about yourself… but why should you bother? A player doesn’t get any reward or in-game progress by doing this, only a large repair bill, which we’ll discuss later.Players can also attack each other’s in-game bases to win resources and Medals, which act as the game’s only ranking system to measure players against each other. And as any player worth their Bomber Squadrons will tell you, these medals are completely worthless, also providing no tangible in-game buffs or benefits, partly because such a system would immediately be exploited by players with multiple accounts. (We’ll also discuss this later.)“REAL-TIME PvP: Real war doesn’t wait its turn - attack enemies at will in real-time.”Sticking point #2: Real war doesn’t wait its turn… but you have to. As alluded to previously, if your ships/base are damaged or destroyed in combat, they must be fixed in real-time before you can use them again. This might only be a few minutes for new players, but an end-gamer at war can easily rack up a week’s worth of repair in 30 minutes play. And when one considers the rock-paper-scissors mechanic employed by the different ship classes, as well as the sheer firepower they can dish out, you might not even need 30 minutes!Of course, one could spend $30 USD in Coins (the game’s premium currency) to fix the damage instantly and get back out there, but if not… better sit back and get fixing. Good luck, Rebels!“GAME EVENTS: Battle in weekly events for top prizes.”This is a big one, so bear with me. Progression in VEGA revolves around the player acquiring Blueprints, for bigger ships, shootier guns and other bits of space kit, in order to move up the proverbial ladder. These events take several forms:1)Riots – these are intended for low-level players to catch up and gain existing items to help them progress. But if you want these items as a newbie, you’d better be prepared to sit and grind out Loot points for the 4 days the event runs for. And this mechanic is considered to be reasonably good…2)Feature Events – these are the big ones. Running once a month, each one has a suitably impressive name, and contains a new hull and a slew of new shiny technologies, which you can win… provided you can beat the special AI targets. As Kixeye’s business wisdom apparently does not extend to play-testing their events in advance, these targets can be anywhere on the spectrum of laughably easy (the first two hours of Scorched Earth) to monstrously powerful (Warfront) or simply mind-numbingly dull (Zero Hour). If you can’t beat them? Git gud, scrublord.But let’s say you power through and win the shiny new things. Alright! What happens now? Well first off, there’s no guarantee your shiny new toys are actually any good, or that they won’t either be buffed into the stratosphere or nerfed into oblivion somewhere down the line. If you don’t believe me on this point, go onto the Kixeye forum and ask someone about the Brimstone Torpedo. Or the Rapture Cruiser. Or the Skirmish Armour. Or the Unstable Reactor. I could go on.In the meantime, you’ll have to allocate Ship Factory time to actually build the shiny new things, or refit them to your existing ships. And with build times being the way there are currently, it could be a while before this happens. I have event prizes I won last year which I’ve never had the chance to build, and now never will. So long, Vigilante Battleship, I hardly knew ye.3)Civil War – this is supposed to be a flagship PvP event, where one can earn points by fighting other players. In reality, these are only won by those with the biggest wallets, or those with the best auto-scripts and most alternate accounts to kill the same fleets over and over again. (Here’s looking at you, [ELU]!) Kixeye have attempted to rectify this by changing the point curve, but all this has accomplished is the punishment of skilful piloting and the encouragement of suicide tactics. The fact that this is beneficial for their bottom line is surely a coincidence.4)Alien Mobilization – space bugs are attacking! This event really is only for the chosen few, but those who can defeat the menace can win exclusive tech, which is either mostly useless or game-breakingly strong (at the time of writing). You want to believe things will get better? Sorry Mulder, you’re wasting your time.“ALLIANCES: Create or join an alliance and crush your enemies.”While you can join your alliances and fly with your buddies, this too remains an incomplete feature; coalitions and alliance wars have yet to be formalised, while the prospect of alliance flagships seems largely forgotten.“CRAFTING: Craft powerful ship upgrades to help you defeat the VEGA Federation.”A lot of players cite the introduction of the crafting system in Oct/Nov 2015 as the point where VEGA Conflict started to fall apart. On paper, it sounds like a good idea; upgrade your ships to get an edge over your enemies/a killer paint job, and the devs get to boost the longevity of their existing content. Everybody wins!Well… not so much. For a start, this system makes late-game hulls very powerful, leaving older tech obsolete, and disproportionately favours certain hull types such as cutters. The crafting materials themselves take a long time to acquire, turning the PvP dream into a PvE black pit. But you need all those bits, because if you don’t get them, you’ll be left behind and at the mercy of the big spenders, who can simply cough up £200 a month and get all the latest gubbinz without lifting a finger. That’s the price you pay to stay competitive.But do you know what the worst bit is? The company knows about all these problems, and simply doesn’t care. People have requested, pleaded and raged about many aspects and features for as long as I can remember; long repair times, a coin confirmation button (the last guy to try and make this happen got fired for his trouble), a refit bay to let players actually test and use their new tech, rampant Civil War scripting, server instability (particularly in crowded sectors), speed normalisation in the Great Grand Rebalance, buffs and nerfs to people’s favourite tech seemingly without rhyme or reason, the time sink of marking up fleets, seemingly unstoppable power creep and the simple fact that this is a very, very expensive game to play. And none of it looks likely to get any better any time soon.So, have I gotten enjoyment out of VEGA over 18 months? Yes. Would I recommend it to you? Not in a million years.Love from [KOS],SternguardJake (46)"
"This is an interesting game.  It is free to play, but like most games of that ilk it is pay to win.  I have been playing for a while (if you saw how many blueprints I have you would know that) and still enjoy the game, but there are many aspects that are a problem.  The first is that of noobs.  The amount of time that it takes for a noob to get anywhere is quite long.  Some of the basic items that require research and build should be reduced significantly.  Second is related to this.  That of build times for any new items.  The time it takes to build a new ship is quite long (some may take upwards of a month) and since you can only build one ship at a time, that is quite bad.  The third item is that of the speed of which new items come into the game.  New items have been coming in faster and faster.  So since it takes so long to build some of the previous ships, you never have time to build the new ships.  The only way around all of this is to spend money and while I have spent a little, I am not really considering putting much into this game since money doesn't go very far in the game.  I really do wish I could recommend the game, but unless the build times can be resolved, I cannot recommend this game to a new player."
After spending years with this game and several 100$'s I must say with the correct direction of a decent CEO would make a big difference. The games gone to crap as it is all about coin.Went for F2P to P2P in 3.2 seconds.
"This game is something, it can be bad it can be good, but players make most of that, I like the game it let you edit your spaceships as you want, and many strategies to use in game, just i dont like the long times to wait to do anything in game, repairs start from few minutes and can go hight as 15 hours to wait and even more! , if you would build a spaceship, probably you would make a real one before the ingame ship is ready, but thats what we got here."
"Good concept, but poorley executed. To be honest I only continue to play because I'm friends with the players in my alliance, and its become habitual for me to log in and check. In order to reach a high combative level, either alot of money, or alot of time needs to be invested, this is definitely a pay to win game."
I feel bad for my young self as i put almost 500 hours into this money-grab excuse of a game.This game had great potential but kixeye made it only worht playing by spending money and i mean a buttload of money and the more you progress the more it would cost. crap game dont even play as a time waster as it wastes brain cells too. However if you have a few thousand dollars to spare youd love this game!
"I have been a beta player for 3 years and I WARN EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND OTHER GAMES BY THIS FRAUDENT DOGFACKERS1) gave players refit discounts without telling them about a major ship rebalance the next day. players paid money for refits that were obsolete and had to REFIT AGAIN 2) Promised no ""premium currency"" for the black market when it was introduced, broke that promise within a week by dropping the value of the blood embers which are already difficult to grind before allowing money to buy black market items for 3 times the value3) placed the ""buy with coin"" button next to the ""buy with normal resources"" button and refused to implement a confirmation button despite player complains on forums regarding accidental spending of money.4) offered newer players false hope by announcing a catch up event which was not ""do-able"" for new players. Sector strike which offered old tech for ""new"" players to ""catch-up"" are still pay2win even when you are lvl60. 5) lied about nerfing some stupidly overpowered event enemy fleet but NEVER provides any details or statistics about how many health or damage was reduced. they even have the audacity to give steath statistics buff to PVE targets mid-event and it has been proven by many ""comparision"" videos on the Youtube.4) Power Creep in this game is world-record breaking, The game is not just Pay2Win but it is mathematically proven to be Pay2 Progress, new tech is released EVERY 2 WEEKS with better stats than the previous. You farm ""A"", which you use to grind faster for ""B"",which gives you a chance to get ""C"" which stays in the ""Overpowered"" meta till ""D"" comes out in 2 weeks time. New players CANNOT progress without spending money even if they feel like they could.5) claim to be a competitive strategy game for hardcore gamers but the gameplay is basically a afk suicide attack, there are not tactics, active hotkey abilities or environmental features and the only ""skill"" about this game was right clicking to position which has been render obsolete because SHITEYE decide to make damage unavoidable. The top players ( Cash Whales ) in the leaderboards have spent close to a thousand dollars per month just to stay dominating.There is nothing wrong with Pay2WIn games, but this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing scam. you have not seen this company of despicable lowlife"
"Extremely long crafting times, microtransactions ruin the game that had potential, I mean its a copy paste of a format that works on mobile, Recently seen atleast 5 other games that are basically exactly the same just in a different enviroment, but same idea, craft, upgrade, attack, repair, pay to play, pay to skip waittimes. Lost interest now that there is noting for me to do in the game aside from waiting 5 days to upgrade my damn base - what to do in the meantime? noting, I don't need resources for anything as I'm just waiting for the upgrade, and there is noting else I can do. I could improve my ships, but major progression is blocked by this 5 day wait, which will repeat over and over again from now on if I choose not to pay."
"Early Access ReviewNever played any of these ""cardgames"" but this is quite fun. Dont know how long the fun lasts since Im getting the sense that this is heavy p2w game.Got game free, have enjoyed alot, would recommend this to anyone, as free, wouldnt pay for it tho."
Early Access Reviewreally fun and competetive game has a great potential to be next popular esports-Premium currency exist but not that pricy nor game changing-you cant level up the minions which is good thus countering pay to win potential-choice of heroes gave the game a good number of win condition  from swarmer to power minions-really easy to learn-really worth the money paid  
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewYou remember that flash games where you have two bases, path between them and you just choose units that pushing ahead courageously no matter what? Sooo it is back, but with some MOBA/card game variations. Pretty enjoyable with short (0,5-5 minute) battles. Strong one more battle effect!"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is a Clash Royale but without the inGame-Buying part (or at least a lot less).This is a pre alpha and have some  bugs and problems, but it still better than Clash Royale"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGewar gane eveb works ob my windows tablet on  low settings, gameplay may look like youre just dropping minions but there is indeed strategy by countering each type of miion/ structure differently."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTHIS GAME IS NOT JUST CLASH ROYALE! ITS BETTER.Sorry for being loud, and telling the truth. It is just better. Heres why:Card levels: First of all there isn't any. That just balances everything out. Level doesn't matter for fighting others. Cards will have no level so no need to worry about a level 13 in your wood league with max cards.Expeditions: You can explore a map with loot and more to find. Easy way to get stronger and newer cards. Battle: We got team battle which me and my friend really enjoy doing, it works well since I gave him another copy I got for free. We also got draft battle which can be fun if you know how to play your cards right!Card Rarity: One of the rarities is supreme...9/10 because one card rarity is supreme..."
"Early Access ReviewI was cautious and skeptical about purchasing this game, considering it's early access and my poor experiences with them. However, I was blown away by this game. The dev support is amazing, and the actual game itself is excellent. It's a fast paced card game that requires strategy and thought in your attacks. Pick this game up with a friend, too."
"Early Access ReviewChoosing between catchphrases for this game:- 50% hearthstone, 50% Dota, 100% fun!- Hearthstone, eat your heart out!- Move over Hearthstone!I bought this game on sale for 49 cents, figuring if I hated it, I wouldnt even bother having to return it.Instead, I was instantly hooked. I'm currently considering buying a bundle before they go off sale.Pros:+++++++++++++++++++ Familiar but legallydistinct characters+ Announcer has good (not great) voice acting+ Fast load times+ Fast match queues+ Holiday events in Beta?!+ low low price of 50 cents!!!+ Simple to learn, difficult to master+ Totally original gameplay+ Auto loads bug forums when crashing+ Can play game with one hand, eat cheetos with the other.Cons-----------------I crashed once, the game recommended lower settings, and suggest I report the bug, taking me to to the bug report forums.- Graphics and interface could use some polish (my biggest complaint so far)- Game should auto generate/submit logs regarding crash, for Quality assurance.- Will probably go free to play after release"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA friend gave this to me, because he got an extra copy. And it is actually quite fun!Kinda like Clash Royale, but has much cooler aspects to it! Definitely recommend it.It is annoying that because I got it as a gift, I don't get the premium Upgrade. So I have to pay for more stuff if I want it. :("
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewYou can currently get a free key for the game here, 12/21/2016: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/giveaway?utm_source=Bundle%20Stars%20Secondary&utm_campaign=bd79caabac-Minion_Masters_Secondary_12_17_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a38c067c43-bd79caabac-429229541&mc_cid=bd79caabac&mc_eid=ef6a02aa93On with the review.Pros:- Multiple layers of strategy, (Positioning, timing, your deck, etc.)- Very generous level up and Rank rewards- A brief, in-depth Tutorial and rewards along with it- Very short match-making times, and highly accurate- Balance for the most part seems fair currently- It is not P2W. You can gain everything with reasonable timeCons:- Very rough around the edges, but expected in Alpha- Some design and artwork appears derivative- Deck possibilities are currently limited, but will improve obviouslyConclusion:The game even right now offers a great deal of fun, and minimal frustration. As you can see I received it for free, so I didn't buy the Premium pack, and have won the majority of my games (Currently at Bronze 3 at level 18). The strategy is very fair, and even Common cards can shutdown or answer expensive high-cost cards. To be more clear, superior decision and strategy absolutely WILL trump a deck that potentially counters your own. The game is very skill dependent, much more so than traditional TCG's, as the added layer of positioning and real-time decisions increase the possibilities of misplays and superior decisions alike.The game is very fair, and generous, and offers a warm welcome to anyone interested in trying it out. "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAbsolutely gripping, quick tactic game that fits to my tastes. Minion Masters is like a fresh experience for me. Different from MOBA games that are flooding the market of video games. Matches last less than 10 minuts which is amazing if you are sick of long time stifing. Game might not look so but it is certainly expanded so you should not be dissappointed.Is it worth 20 euro? No. Not in this form. I would instantly buy it if it would be cheaper than 10 euro. Dunno if it's going to be F2P or not, but i hope so ;)If you have opportunity to try this position, you should definitelly do it!"
"Early Access ReviewYou don't always get ranked with people of the same rank which seriously sucks. Great disadvantage for noobs. Nice graphics and a fun game to play the first hour or two, but not worth the price in my opinion especially when it's ptw."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe highly upgraded Clash Royale has some minor bugs but is poorly optimized. Optimization would want to patch it but it's 3 times better than C.R. 6/10.
"Early Access ReviewI keep trying to go back and play it, but it's just not very good. There's a lot of balance issues... I'll let the bugs slide since it's still early access, but there's a couple game breaking bugs (that I've encountered myself). The game's progression is standard f2p trash. It's slightly improved over Clash Royale, but still involves rolling the dice in hopes of getting the cards that are actually worth using (there's a lot of completely useless cards). The heroes need rebalancing as well. There's a clear gap between the good heroes and the bad ones."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFast PacedFunPretty GraphicsNice Voice-workAddictingI'll give it an... 9.5 so far!(WHAT? IT'S EA, SO IT CAN'T BE GOOD? TAKE IT BACK?... Imma rebel)"
"Early Access ReviewRAGE QUITS AAAAARRRREEEEEE LIIIIIIIFFFEEEE!If you're like me and enjoy nothing more than seeing that ""VICTORY"" overlaid with ""Your Opponent Has Left The Game"", please play this game. They're abundant!"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewYeah this game is fun & is most assuredly worth the asking price. Just another game that wouldn't be here if not for Warcraft III. There's really nothing that I can compare this too unless you are familiar with WC3 custom games. Fast paced 5 minute rounds that can be done 1v1 or 2v2 with a friend. This is not your typical 'turn based' card game. It's a 'real time' strategy game with tactics, but however involve cards that are played when you reach enough mana. Rounds can last longer if both sides are evenly matched, making for a more intense session. Plenty of ingame achievements and quests to earn new cards and such. Thanks BetaDwarf for the free game, will recommend to friends that coop."
"Early Access Reviewfor someone whos Never played this style of game before, to me it's like yu-gi-oh meets bay-blades and I was plesently surprised how fun/gripping this game is, and now i've put over 20 hours into. Would recommend it."
"Early Access ReviewThe idea of this game is decent, it's quite fun to play in your spare time but it justs gets boring, personally I belive it died due to the rise of clash royale. If you want a pc version of clash royale basically you should buy this, I got this game for 39p and with that i got a free copy, so it is quite cheap and comes with 2 games. THis game is pretty fun and is easy to run."
"Early Access ReviewEnjoying this much more than I thought I would.  Works well as a casual game, but also has deeper strategies and rewards skill, so that competitive and higher skilled play feels really good.  Free to play model is very fair - harder to get cards are more situational, not more powerful.  I recommend to buy the premium upgrade in order to speed up card acquisition, but it is not necessary you still get full enjoyment from the game without spending the money."
"Early Access ReviewOne of the better free to play competative games out there. Really don't feel like I am getting out $$$'d when I play. It seems like everything is about how you play, and it's really quite decent."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI waited to review this game specifically so I could tick the box ""Check this box if you received this product for free"".It's ok if you're into Clash Royale."
"Early Access ReviewGame is a ton of fun. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who just wants to relax and throw down some cards and watch minions beat a tower down. Also, its only in beta so the few bugs that are there will be eventually worked out. The 2v2 is ALSO a ton of fun with a friend. The strategy of the game is what makes it even more fun especially when its 2v2! GLHF to all that buy this!"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI've never really cared to devote myself to an RTS due to the complexities of tech trees and feeling like I was never learning and constantly overwhelmed. This ""new wave"" of Clash Royale/Halo Wars ""Blitz Mode"" style of RTS games has been amazing to me for those reasons. And, Minion Masters, really takes the simplistic style of Clash Royale (which is perfectly fine for a mobile focused title) and adds a nice dash of variety and complexity. My only concern is that these more ""casual"" style games can fail for seemingly no reason on PC to ever catch on. Hopefully, this is not one of those titles as I would love to play this for a while into the future."
"Early Access ReviewThis game is exactly the same type of game as Clash Royale. This is game is far superior to Clash since it is not pay to win at all, when you unlock a unit/card, you own the entirety of that unit and you don't upgrade and you are not forced into waiting unlike CLashs where you can pay in gems if you want to quicken the processes of the game, you either buy with a fair price unlike Clash, or you wait. WHEN YOU GET A BOX, YOU CAN OPEN IT AND NOT WAIT HOURS UPON HOURS JUST TO OPEN AND THERE IS NO LIMIT FOR BOXES. EVEN THE STARTER deck is effective, but i believe that you need to tweak that deck a little, which you can for free by playing for a couple of hours, which is very fair for a free to play game. There are no overpowered cards in my opinion, but some cards are very specific in there use so they can be considered as being worse, so you don't need a legendary or epic to win, actually you need to think a lot to win in a hard game. There are a lot of heroes that have 3 abilities that you gain periodically upon obtaining exp ingame while controlling bridges and these heroes combo with card decks, ingenius.The bottom line is, get this game, you won't regret it."
Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewas a top player top 60 200+ hours i can recommend this game. i have my own personel run in with TGXAndy and you can too!Me and him have become one and our lives matter not compared to the inevitability you will face.This game is a means to a end of everything but also a begining of something more beautiful and less cumbersom.Be calm now for the pain is numbing and memories fleeting for the future is vast as the mind is small.
Early Access ReviewDont expect to have a remote chance of getting all the units neccessary to keep up unless you're willing to shell out an obscene ammount of money. Shamefull greed from what was a good developer.
"Early Access ReviewExpeditions Rework.Now expeditions give less loot and have only 3 PvE battles and completing them gets you locked out of the expedition so you must wait about 6 days for the next one to unlock. Pretty much it's harder to get new cards and now it lacks the ability to find a variety of loot. IMO it's poorly made, simplier than the previous and the game itself feels much more grindy than before. In other words, i've lost interest playing."
"Early Access ReviewBuggy, with a needlessly convoluted and user-unfriendly interface, limited multiplayer options, and only a short tutorial existing for single-player, the straightforward combat and imbalanced deck design don't allow for the gameplay to make up for the game's other troubles.If the game cleans up its interface and bugs, polishes gameplay, and either implements better single-player features or the promised 2v2 mode, the game'll have enough compelling elements to draw attention, as the basic concept is (while not particularily original) compelling enough.In other words, this is a game that rather firmly reflects its Early Access label (in a rather unflattering way), and should be avoided until it gets closer to live-launch- which, hopefully won't be for some time yet, given how much still needs to be addressed.(As an added note, while the game has had more than its fair share of bugs and quirks and odd management decisions up to this point, my own interactions with Betadwarf staff have been very positive and friendly and respectful, which does make the developer stand out among the far less respectable norm. As such, with the developer indicating their willingness to give respectful consideration toward their user-base, there's firm reason to hope that similar consideration will be offered toward fixing the game's current shortcomings.) "
"Early Access ReviewA fun, much less P2W version of Clash Royale. The random 2v2 mode means that you get to enjoy playing with a team without having to always have someone online. I suggest trying this game out."
"Early Access ReviewThe game is good. I would recommend this game. Why? I can answer you:+1. Good graphic;+2. Many characters;+3. Interesting for your brain.Ok. We knaw pluses and i know some minuses and i can tell you:-1. Donations;-2. I do not like Clash Royale. This game copied it.Pluses more than minuses, and I like it."
Early Access ReviewPlease bare in mind that this is a early access game but at the moment the amount of cards available is extremely limited and I think that you would need to be willing to invest a lot of money in order to get the most out of this game.  Very simplistic and repetitive maybe with further development the game could be good but at the moment it is not worth the asking price.
"Early Access ReviewMinion Masters is strategy card game. It have kinda unique style since your cards summon creatures charge blindly toward their opponents. You only decide where and when to summon 'em. There are two bridges connecting the arena. Once your minions cross it, it becomes under your control. You earn EXP to upgrade you master's perks by controlling bridges. Each master have his/her unique perks.The graphics are stunning. The texture is very detailed. The animation is so awesome.The soundtrack ain't bad. The sound FX are great.The gameplay is good. you can either fully play with the mouse or you can choose the cards by QWER to save fractions of sec that really matters.There are twelve Solo missions to practice with a reward every four missions.The multiplayer mode works smoothly. it takes really few seconds to find an opponent. I haven't encountered any Lagging playing in multiplayer until now tho.Each cards requires a certain number of mana. You can make your own deck in the main menu.To get new cards you got to buy power tokens which costs way to much Gold or Rubies which you got to pay real money to acquire it.The settings and options are good. You can adjust the music, Sound FX or the dialogue for the audio options. You can change anything you gonna need to change or to adjust in video settings which is pretty awesome.Since it's gonna be Free to play there are lots of microtransactions. It's gonna be nearly pay to win game. Still since the last time I've written my first review there was quite impressive updates and features for an example there are now free tokens that gives you some Gold, Shards or Rubies. The game is still under development but still pretty good and fun to play.If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews. Check Cassus.org "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewPlayed it for 20 days, got to GM 1 in 2v2, ggezAnd now seriously, it's a great game, quick matches, not pay to win at all. You can easily reach the GM rank with the basic cards that everyone has and same for the Master. Lots of fun tournaments and there's enough meme cards, what more do you wantThe only negative thing I have to say about this game is that the matchmaking is completely broke when it comes to the 2v2 mode"
"Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewunbalanced and even tho you pay 20€ the game it's still pay to win, i'v met wooden 5 players (lowest category) who beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me within 2 minutes, tho i got this game for free so i guess its worth it but if i would have to buy it i'd throw it in the trash and never look back"
"Early Access Review1vs1 combat this game is great, all you need is to use your cards and their power wisely than your enemy and you can win easy, but this feels pay to win game sometimes in starting unless you give sometime to play this game and use everything you get as reward very wisely, make a good deck and nice combination gives an easy victory.I completely fell in love with this game and kept playing to rise higher in ranked battles, tried many different combinations, with different playstyle and masters and found a good enough deck to defeat many of other players easily.Watch some gameplay here:>>>   https://youtu.be/tITUuk1O7Is "
"Early Access ReviewAfter getting to grand master, i can now say that this review is still true. Gameplay is fun, but all decks are boring, all decks seem like an exploit and the big majority of players only play two or three decks with slight variations. I can conclude saying that this game is a big unbalanced mess.-- edit again ---Edit after +70h of gameplay.At least all those kind of games are similar. You have fun at the beginning where everyone is ""new"" and everyone does its best to get a nice deck and play strategically. The more you play and rank up, the more you find players that exploit a mechanic or create virtually impossible decks unless you play another counter-meta deck.And this becomes a circle where the one who plays more meta is the winner. So has become very boring after a while. I'm going to change my recommendation and left it as a ""play for a few weeks / months"".-- old review --Enjoying the game so far.Its a mix between clash Royale and heartstone mechanincs in a PC brawler. Not completely unbalanced, and kinda fair. also has micro transactions but the game is not a ""level this card"" game.The character animations are pretty bad. Character designs stolen from wow are there as well as other major design flaws and an atrocious ui, but the gameplay is nice and fun to play.I recommend the game if you can get it for free"
"Early Access ReviewYet another competitive deck-builder, right? Well, sorta. The thing is, I would have given it a negative review based on how generic it is until they recently started spicing things up with new content, better resource management, better balancing, etc. The heroes are cute, the art style is cartoony but fine, strategy is medium-simplistic, and I like the new expeditions they introduced, typically 1 per week.All-in-all, it's light fun especially versus a friend. 7/10"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewCute game, quite engaging. So far I only did the battles vs. the AI and won all of them quite easily - well, they are the introduction to battles vs. players.Positive:  + Action rich lane-defense system.+ Well thougt out game mechanics+ varying masters (the guys we players pick as proxy) with different skillsets+ AI-enemies are not lobotomized+ large variety of minionsNegative:- Payment for Premium Access suggests a gigantic boost. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against microtransactions - even programmers and designers have to eat and servers need energy too - but the act of balancing it is hard. If you can do it as pay for convenience and not pay to win, it's perfect. Well, a bit of balancing ^^- common minions seem to get replaced with way better rare minions (lower costs to place them). This is a mayor problem. To be a pay for convenience game this would need to be balanced. Current recommendation: Give it a try as it is a nice game - don't pay too much though."
"Early Access ReviewProbably best to wair for release.  Right not there is no real tutorial, there is a sort of mechanics demo but that doesnt really teach you any when or why.  It then launches you straight into pvp with no real knowledge of the systems and you must win several games before you gain access to any of the systems like that shop.The community appears to be quite friendly.    That is quite rare for an online game."
"Early Access ReviewGreat little game.  Reminds me a LOT of Hearthstone, only it's better.  The animations and even strategy of where to place your units when starting battles add a whole extra dimension to the game.  Great variety of units and lot to learn to learn the nuances of which units counter which the best.It's a great fast paced game with a lot of strategy.  It feels a little pay to win, but then that's the way with pretty much all free 2 play games.  When you start ranking up you quickly run into players with much better cards.  However this is no different to almost every other F2P game and certainly no different to Hearthstone.  In short, well worth a visit.  Be warned it's addictive as hell and definitely will cause you to say, ""just one more round""."
Early Access ReviewI don't get it.  How is this fun?  I'm not seeing the advanced strategy here.  This feels like the kind of game you'd play on your phone.  The description of this game is rather misleading.
"Product received for freeEarly Access Review*sigh*, I really want to love this game, and deep down I really do. But the path the devs have taken has gone for the worst. I love BetaDwarf, they have a very Nintendo feel to them, players first, fun with friends first and coop friendly and enjoyable games…but like Nintendo they just went downhill. Like Nintendo these people are milking their franchise to the ground with every game being a “Forced” game, but unlike Nintendo that just managed to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, this company isn’t. Their newest update makes me sick not like their previous expe 2.0 was any better, we all know how rude the devs were. BetaDwarf must think the loot box craze is still in it’s early stages with everyone not complaining as much and companies getting away with it. Minion Masters isn’t only a payed game, but you now have to pay (around £6.99 extra) to get an extremely long and stupid “Battle Pass”. Last I checked BetaDwarf only free games do this to gain some extra money. This game also feels very pay to win…even if it’s a payed game, it’s rather disgusting (yes i know it will be free in the future). Very glad I got it for free cause I owned every other Forced game and rather enjoyed them. BUT even after I shot every last bullet from my gun at BetaDwarf and hating on them, this game is far more fun that the mobile version made by (tries not to throw up) Suppercell, Clash Royal. That game is even worse if you can imagine…not like that’s saying anything for Minion Master but it’s what’s keeping me with them. Yes, I’ve played and unfortunately payed in Clash Royal for about a year (when it first came out, only payed once thank the lord). Either way Minion Masters just shot itself in the foot with its update, and it will lose a lot of players with the new “Battle pass”. Shame another game had to die cause of developer’s greed and not noticing what it did good."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSince i got this game for free, my opinion is a little skewed because things are always better when they're free. Moving on, Minion Masters is a neat little RTS (Real Time Strategy) type of game where you take control of a hero and a deck of 10 minions, buildings, or spells of your choosing. Your objective is to destroy the enemy base using the fun-sized playing field. All you have to do is just place your card, and it'll do its own thing. With a fairly big variety of cards it'll keep you entertained just trying out how they can all work together. And if you're good at strategy/card games, then you'll have fun climbing the ranks and decimating all the noobs on your way there."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI get a free access game from one of the devs. Its a fun game. So far i had no feeling i get payed out or anything like it. And i have not spend any money in it. I lose some games but most of them i won. I love the team game mode. The rest of the modes are not my cup of tea. Single play feels like any card game you need to have a perfect build and hope the other dont have the counter deck or a better pick. So the team mode is the only option if you want a random win/lose and not a paymyway dude before you. Even if you have the best deck or cards. The other one can have ****** the worst cards you can think of. And so you lose. This mode fits my game style. I do not like playing the ""perfect mode"" like all games in this style. Including dota league and so on. If you want fun just give this mode a try and see. If you want the perfect mode than you can pay your way or earn it like a real trooper and not going in QQ mode when other people spend money in it and your not!"
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game just gets old really quick with very little reward for playing it takes up to 2+ hours to get enough wins for the quest rewards when playing with a friend. Time is better spent elsewhere
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAverage strategy game I can recommend it.+ I especially like 2vs2 mode because the 1v1 is slow at least for me+ No lag or fps issues+ My favorite desk hero would be ranger op op+/- Build ultimate deck of cards to find out that you cannot use the same one+/- There are an pve battles in special events but 90% is focused on pvp+/- Ranking system and its rewards- Bit of grind but hey got it for free- Loot box card system which I hate +/- Update 76 removed steam icons. I liked that featured a lot but I can see why it got removed.- Also from update 76 not working fullscreen.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewReal time strategy, pvp, tower defense, card game. Easy to get into, can be played 1v1 or 2v2. I usually am not one for virtual card games but I enjoyed this game, theres more to it than just selecting cards. Positioning of your unit(s) is just as important and even more so at times, spells have to be properly timed and manually aimed aswell."
"Early Access ReviewGreat game, don't fall into the negativity.  This game is solid and fun as heck!  The average wait time for an online match is roughly 5-10 seconds. The single mode is repetitive because its the same tutorial just at harder difficulties. The main part of the game is the online mode and it is wonderful! I definitely say get this in the Humble Bundle Monthly package!(December only)"
"Early Access ReviewJust another whale hunting game disguised as FTP. You need to spend money to compete and break rank gold, else you get left behind. Grinding rewards pathetic pittances for hours and hours."
Early Access ReviewIt's a lot like Clash Royale except there's not that gross feeling of being outplayed by someone who's spent more time/money on their decks by upgrading them.  As far as i can tell units can't be upgraded at all so a hard counter is a hard counter always.   There's some microtransactions build around gaining new cards here but they don't feel necessary to progress or win.  I've won almost all my online matches 5-10 of them so far and i haven't spent a dime on it.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI have played this game for a very short amount of time on an early access version but I can already say that for Â£3.99 this game is well worth the price. I got it for free, but I would have gladly paid for it. There are constantly new updates coming through and the game is easy to pick up with an online aspect that makes the actual gameplay even more exciting. The quality of the game is pretty good. Unfortunately there is some ""pay to win"" aspects to the game and after level 10 the game becomes very difficult for players not used to the content but gives those more experianced with the kind of game a good challenge.At the time of writing the game is in early access so there will be various updates that may change the gameplay but overall it is a game full of exciting gameplay."
"Early Access ReviewVery nice Game. Unless Clash Royale this Game is NOT p2w as some people claim. You get cards fluently and enough Gold/Shard to make sufficient and efficient Decks. Rather than complaining that you dont have specific Cards, you should look for a way to utilize your Cards and Masters."
"Early Access ReviewWith each new expansion there will be OP meta cards that create insane combos with the existing ones, Be prepared to get rolled over by them or the other option is to spend money to unlock battlepass and buy battlepass exp so you can get them and roll other people over too."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAs ""clash-royale-esque"" games go, it's not bad. Its really easy to play.I'm not a fan of the genre so I'm uninstalling, but its definately worth giving a try.Havent found any bugs or technical issues.Even the announcer isn't that annoying."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFantastic game. Fun to play, easy to learn, skill based more than anything. All content in the game can be earned by play.Dev's are involved with the game constantly, allowing you to give feedback on bugs or suggestions for the game. Active balance changes come readily, as well as a stable competitive mode.The community is great as well, available in game or on their Discord channel.tl:dr this game is like Clash Royale but better."
"Early Access ReviewOnce you get past the initial bracket (to which you can never return), you will find the meta is two Masters and three decks between them.  The game is fun, as long as you play any of those in-meta decks, but if you set even a toe outside of the meta, you will find a massive drop off in playability.It was pretty engaging for a couple days, though."
Early Access Reviewok so beta dward does NOT have an option on there website where I can contact support. and I keep running into freaking losers who suck so bad at the game that they have to cheat. like mods and glitches and♥♥♥♥♥♥   and ive written the names  of like over 35 people who I cought cheating. so i need support to get ahold of me
"Early Access ReviewThis game is a poor knock off of a mobile title called Clash Royal. If you like these kinds of games, look elsewhere. There is no balance with regards to deck building and the matchmaking system is still pretty rough. I played several days and have a high win rate but it doesn't feel right, most matches are one sided so there's hardly a feeling of victory when you win. On an aesthetic note, the art style and in game models leave a lot to be desired. Overall I'm not a fan and considering they've already invested so many resources into what they have now, I'm not hopeful for the future of this product."
"Early Access ReviewSimiliar to Clash Royale, but a very greater game and now its FTP i will gurantee you its not P2W,like many others i bought like a 10.000 rubies at start and now i dont know where to spend it.I appreciate the developers for making such a great game.Lastly if you played any games like Clash Royale you ll like it."
"Access ReviewThis game has good potential.  Even if you put money in you arent always going to win.  They seem to care and keep up with meta blanaces and fixes.  I hope to see more things added such as new game modes, cards, and masters.  The community is also pretty good overall."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt is fun but ain't the balanced game ever...I mean stun minions vs stun minions is like who its gettin first da hit...Still beta so I give a reccomend!
"Access ReviewDo you like money? No? Well then i have the game for you, Minion Masters!.The first litteral Pay to Win game iv seen in a long time, dont like grinding? go ahead buy your way to the top in this heavily unbalanced attempt at cashing in on the TCG genre. Cant get the card you want? Dont you worry your master will win the game for you.How did you ruin a game that was perfectly fine during paid access beta?"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA simple game that is great fun! Me and my friends stayed up all night playing. It has a clean UI, simple controls, and is easy to learn and to play. You build a ""deck"" of ten cards which cycle through as you use them, each with their own mana costs. You use these cards to destroy the other player's main tower and win. Or have your own tower blow up and lose. This game is still in early access, but that makes it even better. It is a great game with the content it already has, meaning that everything added during it's early access days will only improve on how amazing it is."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game tries hard to have a balanced meta until you realize you can use a cheesey strat to flood the map with low HP minions to win most games. If you build to counter the cheese strat, then you will lose to regular varied builds that try to have some intelligence."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewMinion masters is a deck-building pvp game in which you try to destroy the enemy champion by using a selection of cards – minions and powers – to overrun his minions. This is a very simple concept, and sounds like it could be fun. But the problem with the game is that while it’s pvp and needs to have a fairly level playing field, but everything is locked away from you except some cards and free champions.The way one unlocks the content is through grinding. I think you need to play at least 30 games to unlock a token to roll for a card (besides the daily gifts and levelling up rewards). Roll, as in you get a completely random card. If you got a card you don’t like, you can exchange it for some shards, which you can use to unlock a different card. And again you need far too many shards to unlock the card that you want compared the amount of games you played in the meantime. After getting enough cards, you need to unlock champions, for which you can also use shards. It just never ends. And it doesn’t help that you can’t even test decks out before deciding to buy certain cards, to get to know how they feel against other minions. At least there’s a free champion rotation to test them out. For a pvp game, it punishes beginners with bad luck far too hard.These problems are “solved” by a system of microtransactions and a premium upgrade. The premium upgrade costs enough to unlock all content immediately. And microtransactions on top of that is too much. And this when the game is still in early access. The way the grinding in this game works really feels like a way to lead the players to spend more money to quickly unlock cards, arenas and champions – and to be honest I am disgusted with such anti-consumerism. Giving away the game to fans of their previous games and to a friend doesn’t excuse a company to implement this kind of things. I have lost a lot of respect for the developers when I saw that implementation."
Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewin its current state its not recommended a win will net you 50 gold which it takes 1000 gold to purcahse a token to get 1 card on top of the the spellcasters you do not get one for free so you have to save up to get one while useing the two that are on free rotation at that time which i beleive the total real world cost of a spellcaster is about 10 dollars a bad business model that will not hold a player base for long.
"Early Access ReviewThe Game is so broken Getting people who is league rank higher than me You get xp even you aren't controling any brige ( the worse thing i ever saw in games ) I can't even find how to get blue crystals ( it says by scraping cards, like HOW ) There are some cards who are nothing and they cost is so bigYou need to work on this game before you even release it. So go ahead move the game to unpurchasable. It will be better for a game. "
"Early Access Reviewnot a fan... incredibly unbalanced game. I own all but like 8 cards and still manage to get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. I know how to counter other plays and when i see something new i try to incorporate it, usually to no change in the♥♥♥♥♥handing. Ive tried swarmer decks, all big uns deck, mixed decks, puff decks, spell decks etc etc. also when i play the ravager, the first raveger i send out dies in like 4 hits where the enemy ravager just tanks everything and i seemingly do no damage to it."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis is a straight clone of Clash Royale on iOS. It currently offers no improvement over that title, and playing with a mouse is less fun than using a touchscreen."
Early Access ReviewI really don't know why there are microtransactions in a game that is 20$If this was a free to play game I wouldn't mind it but come onOh well I got it for free so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"Product received for freeEarly Access Review5/10I played through the tutorial, and it held my hand through it, nothing special about it, afterwords it suggested I play some solo bot rounds, said I'd get a reward after four wins. Played through them, each one getting a bit harder as I went. Expect the last one before the prize, it was way too easy compaired to any of the bots before it. The prize was a little lackluster, I expected a little more than 'Random card spin' token. Decided after that to play a pvp match, test the waters. The wait time was great, thirty seconds max. The person I got matched against was not. I was no where near ready for who I went up against, literally being in a league different than my own (I was in wood league, they were in a metal league, unsure the tier names or ranks). The slaughter was incredibly mood ruining. The game itself is good, a nice spin as far as it goes (I think clash of clans has something exactly like this, however I'm unsure which came first.) the solo play was nice, but, it left something to be desired, and the vs player mode was insanely unbalanced and completely unpleasent. I personally won't be playing more, but simply because the game doesn't interest me too much at the moment. I do suggest trying it yourself if possible."
"Early Access Reviewthe balance is awful, too much rock paper scissor and then you get dealt a hand of rock and they get all paper. gg not fun no players either so you always play against the same exact p2w players."
"Early Access ReviewI can't remember where I picked this up, I'm pretty sure it was a bundle because I got a Steam Gift key as well. I know its been given out in a couple giveaways already.Anyway, this game has promise, but it's sorely lacking in content at this stage of development. On the plus side, it runs well on my laptop (2 year old mid range gaming laptop), the gameplay is easy to pick up, graphics are decent. On the negative side, they expect a $20 buy in and the game is almost nothing but micro transactions from then on. You can earn rewards by playing, mainly gold with a daily chance for gems shards (for crefting cards) and rubies (the premium currency). From there it's set up like a MOBA, you have to buy heroes and arenas (which are purely cosmetic so why do they cost money?). And you collect cards to use as minions. Very basic 2 lane set up, control the center points to increase mana production, dispatch minions to defend your hero and attack the enemy hero. Progression seems slow even with the ""Premium"" upgrade, there's no story or interesting flavor text to make the heroes and minions seem interesting, it's just... meh. If you get a free key it's worth checking out, but I don't think it's worth the asking price for the premium upgrade. Maybe keep an eye on it for future development if it improves."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is a ""buy shards"" ""buy tokens"" ""buy crystals"" etc. kind of game. You can do this properly and you can do this in a disturbing way that's overly trying to distract you from the fact that you're supposed to be tricked into unloading cash to the devs. This is the later. That alone is enough to not recommend the game, but there are things I don't like about the gameplay too.Another Castle Fight... -like? That other mobile game locked cards behind ranks. This one also locks cards by having to unlock them with ""Currency"". Currently it doesn't look like playing the game is enjoyable enough to justify the wait until you actually have the deck the want. That's bad.But my problem is another one, I think the randomness messes with the idea of counters. I mean, obviously I should build my deck in a way that can counter stuff, but I found myself too often with no counter for what the enemy was throwing at me. Not entirely sure if that's because I suck at building decks or because the cards are too diverse for the card slots you have.Castle Fight worked because you could easily see what your enemy had and if you knew the game you knew how to counter it. That lead to long games, but it also lead to actual enjoyment."
"Early Access ReviewFairly mindless rock-paper-scissors spam game that is....well, let's be charitable and say Heavily Inspired™ by Blizzard's design philosophy. Expect regular profile level ups, multiple types of F2P currency, chests with fancy endorphin-releasing explosions of loot, and gameplay crafted to make you feel like no matter what you do, you're playing well. These developers saw the money being made hand-over fist by Hearthstone and decided to take their own crack at the ""flashy skinner box with puddle-deep gameplay"" genre. The game is 1) technically competent and 2) addictive in the cheap psychologically manipulative way you've come to know if you've played any F2P game in the past three years. These two things are all it takes to squeeze money out of children and those with poor self-control, so I'm sure the publisher's stockholders will be happy."

"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewUnfortunately this game suffers from the typical CCG element of payment options giving far too much of an advantage over non-paying customers. If you can look past that it is a decently fun game, however with glaring flaws and some frustrating gimmicks. In its current state I don't think I could recommend this to anyone due to its frustration, unless you are a CCG fan...probably best to steer clear."
"Early Access ReviewI regret spending money on this. Somewhere in here is a fun game but it's seriously laking right now. Once you complete all the ""challenges"" there's no way to play against AI unless you do the challenges again. Playing against other players means that you either destroy them with superior deck construction or you get absolutely dominated by cards that you couldn't possibly afford yet. Y'know, unless you're like 90% of the people I've played against and have dumped $20-$40 into the game.I can count on one hand the number of games I've lost because of mistakes I've made. The rest are all because I was swarmed by max upgraded cards and high level minions that I will never be able to buy. I've spent 30+ hours trying every deck composition available to me and I still only win about 1 in evey 10 games.Then there's the power tokens. Every four power tokens is supposed to be a gauranteed rare. I always, ALWAYS get money. Never seen a legendary even once. They cost 2000 shards and you'll be lucky if you get 75 from a spin after about 5 or 6 games. But you go into matches and seen entire decks made of legendary cards that are upgraded to the max. Ask for help in chat and you get the ""Git gud"" speech from level 100 players. Did I mention you also get about half XP unless you buy, buy, buy? Yeah, no thanks.It's such a shame. The game could be so great but you just don't stand a chance unless you spend at least $40 on the game and I'm not spending it. I don't think you should either.  :-/TLDR: Fun at first but quickly becomes a frustrating pay 2 win. $20 DLC."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt is addicting in nature like every other freemium game out there spinning lights and the idea that you can outsmart or outplay your opponent no matter what well thats not the case.

"Early Access ReviewI actually got this game from a code when ordering stuff online and gave it a go. Since then I got the premium package on sale.I really like the gameplay. The game is well made and everything works. I won't say that Minion Masters has ""potential"", because it would give out the wrong idea. Although this is an early access title, it's already well thought out and seems to have a workable monetization method. The game is currently quite well balanced, and I believe the devs would have a hard time ruining this game even if they tried, unless they do something incredibly stupid. They do, however, have to be really careful when adding new cards to the game in the future.You don't have all the cards when you begin, but you don't really need most of them either. You can get a long way with just the cards you start with. You get new cards in multiple ways, e.g. completing achievements, using power tokens, playing draft or using shards. So the more you play the bigger your collection will become.I really liked playing draft, and for new players I would recommend playing quite a bit of draft after picking up some experience. In draft you pick randomized masters and cards from the whole selection, so it's a great place to try out how they work before you add them to your collection with shards. Don't play your first games in draft, though, since draft tickets cost gold. I would advise that you play battle or team battle until you reach silver / gold ranks because the players in draft can be really good.Tips for using resources: buy masters with rubies, cards with shards and power tokens / draft tickets with gold. In draft, if you get 7 wins you get even.If I had any bad things to say about Minion Masters, I would say that draft MU is sometimes bad and easily fixable. I hope the devs address this issue. Overall it's a great game and well worth it on the current sale (0,99 â‚¬). The premium pack % bonus is negligible in my opinion, but it's still a good value for rubies/shards at the moment if you would prefer that."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewLike Clash royale for Pc.Slow updates and little number of minions spoil the experience though.I especially suggest trying the tag mode in which you can side up with another person (friend or random) and face 2 other persons.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewReally enjoying this game. Yeah it costs $15, but they give you like 30 card packs (I got nearly every card in the game), 2k shards (enough for a legendary), a bunch of gold. The level progression is quick and full of rewards. The gameplay can be clunky at times, but for early access this is a really fun game. Cards don't have levels so I don't understand people saying P2W. This is no different then hearthstone except the cards duke it out like Clash Royale. I will continue to play this. https://youtu.be/mziMcbYgjXc "
"Early Access Reviewhttps://youtu.be/zs9nQVnLjLwIt's a simple to pick up and get addicted game that could have a vast amount of strategy. Imagine Hearthstone plopped on its side, give the cards 3D models and basic AI, and you've got an idea of what Minion Masters is."
"Early Access ReviewI received the game for free. Its seem fun but I have to unlock news troops by winning multiplayers fights and since I keep loosing, progression is very slow ( you can get daily free token too ). I cant recommend it for 1 main reason, dev ( Betadwarf ). I loved more Forced showdown ( made by Betadwarf too ) but server have alot trouble and I never received answers from dev. I cannot imagine Minion master working well since its a MP only focused game. Game itself, I had no problem ( Minion masters ) no crash or bug but my play time is low. Buy at your own risk !"
"Early Access ReviewThis game is designed to suck people's time, using persuasive technology such as:- daily login rewards,- daily quests,- battle passes with daily XP boost,- loot boxes- the need to grind massively to unlock important cards"""

Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI enjoy the games mechanics - style is very fun to watch and play (lessens the losing imo somewhat) Overall it's a fantastic game!! Get a free token (if you remember to log in daily) Just a very nice change- the way your cards are introduced to you as a whole - to let you know which does what. Also the way they pvp plays out with live duels. I'm loving it. I did the Beta fro this game and honestly I uninstalled it 3x before finally sitting down and finding time to work the mechanics of it out and get what was going on. I enjoy playing it now and am looking forward to getting the other versions now especially since they are on sale.
"Early Access ReviewOne of the games in my nightly rotation. The tactics were frustrating at first (especially when they made balancing changes) but vastly improved once I became pragmatic. For those who like a quick card-driven arena style tumble, it's a pleasant excursion"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt's a really cute game, similar to Clash Royale but way better in my opinion.It's quite a time killer and I really enjoy playing it.I warmly reccomend it to anyone so you should atleast consider it."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAlthough I admire the effort that went into the development of the game; it does look incredibly polished! It looks and plays like the sort of game that would lend its self more to a mobile device than PC.This game is not for me. 
"Early Access Reviewvery fun, a lot like clash royal but for a pc :)could be a little lighter (in terms of RAM and stuff), though my pc is pretty old and has 4GB ram...keep up the good work! :)"
"Early Access ReviewAchei bem♥♥♥♥♥♥o jogo, um moba em 3D, me lembrou mto Smite, joguei bem pouco porém pretendo jogar por mais tempo!.Pontos Negativos: Pelomenos comigo as configurações de video estavam bem estranhas, com quedas de fps, mas acho que eram por causa dos meus drivers de video.Fiquei Muito revoltado pq comprei o jogo na sale, se passaram 2 dias e ouve uma giveaway do jogo e muitos o obtiveram de graça :/"
"Early Access Reviewas of right now I find this game, a very interesting one. becuase this game is more a play2win than a pay2win because every month there is a ladder to climb (re=climb every month) and you can see which cards are used by the best players and can create a deck like them without in some cases needed to have a lot of powerfull cards that are difficult to get.but is it worth the 5 euro?I think it's not worth it, i think they should make it F2P or lower the price because after buying game there still are options of in-game stuff that need to be bought with money."
Early Access ReviewStarted playing this game earlier this week so am still getting to grips with the game. That said I keep returning so it must offer something that has hooked me. So far I have dropped the smallest amount of cash as I feel it has given me something to make it worth giving the developers something and I may even go premium. As it is free to play you have nothing to lose by giving it a shot and I feel it is worth at least that if not a lot more.
"Early Access ReviewIn the huge wave of free (might I add; crappy, not so good) games, there's gonna be that one that stands out from the rest and is actually worth playing aside of just gathering its' trading cards.This one is IT! It's a really fun game especially if you are playing against a friend.Its simple to play, gets competetive and offers a large variety of cards to choose from and the deck building just adds another layer to the game to keep you playing!Give this a shot, especially if you got it for free..."
"Early Access ReviewI love strategy games and, having liked clash royale apart from the crappy progression system. this game fixes those issues and brings in a decent way to unlock the heroes you want."
"Early Access ReviewStraight up Clash Royale for PC but with better everything. Graphics and mechanics are amazing, game doesnt even seem to be Early Access. Have not seen a bigger flaw yet, only maybe that its pretty much P2W with microtransactions which shouldnt exist since you have to buy the game and it might ruin the game in future with lotta hackers or rich kids spending loads of money on game."
"Early Access ReviewI find Minion Masters really fun and challenging. The multiplayer 1vs1 competetive matches are always interesting because you have to figure out what your opponents next move is going to be in order to counter it. I really like the game-design, because it scales so well. This game can be either extremely competetive, or a casual game that you play for fun. It all depends on how much effort you put into it and how badly you want to become the best at the game :PFurthermore there are a lot of cool features in the game. For example, you can try building different decks to suit your playstyle, whether it be flooding your opponent with many small cost minions or using fewer minions that cost more, but are very strong and have a lot of health.I feel like Betadwarf have been generous with giving new players a chance to compete, because while leveling up, you get free chests containing new cards and you also receive bonus coins which enables you to buy more chests, in order for you to build up a proper deck to compete with. Overall I really think this is a game worth playing, especially if you like online competetive games. "
"Early Access ReviewThis is a great game. You can tell the developers put a lot of time and effort in to this game. With very frequent updates and very fun and simple to play, yet hard to master gameplay. The developers also pay close attention to ""the meta"" and nerf and buff cards as necessary. I feel that the rate at which you unlock cards and heroes is really good and even though you can pay for a premium currency it never bothered me. It always felt to me that with the unique wildcard system there was always a new deck to try out and play and that even though I never paid I still had a very enjoyable time playing the game and also very good chances at winning. And if you look at the leaderboards, the top decks use very few rare cards, if any, but the rare cards are still fun and unique.(rare as in they are rare to obtain, so the legendary and supreme cards not the actual ""rare cards"")Tl;dr : It's a great game that's so worth the price of admission."
"Early Access ReviewOnce you get high enough in rank, you'll start to realize just how shallow the gameplay is. Needs more cards and strategies before this game is worthwhile. Some decks and master combination perform better vs others. That's pretty much it. How well you actually play is negligible."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIs maybe one of the most well balanced games out there, since it will be free to play. You can purchase everything in game with the in game currency. Even if you are unlucky with the cards you get, you can still craft them, the legendary cards are not op as hell like in every other game, it has a cool sense of humor and it is fun to play."
"Early Access Review Sadly, this game is either pay2win or grind without end. To get enough resources to build a decent deck you have to grind alot. Even with the ""Premium Pack"" you have to invest way too much time to actually get anywhere. The devs are looking at Hearthstones business modell any try to copy it in regard of how you much you get when you play which is certain death for some small indie game on steam."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTHE GAME IS REALLY GOOD.BUT!Matchmaking is a complete disaster, like a ♥♥♥♥ing joke! I was at Gold4 rank and stepped down Silver2. I wanted to get back to at least gold but all of my matches were against opponents are above 5 to 10 rank above me, so naturally I couldn't even get back up to Silver1 for 12HOURS STRAIGHT!! And now I'm uninstalling this♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is already pay to win thanks to Premium DLC and Humble Bundle. People probably will play faster than you because of premium and you can't win against premium AT ALL. This game was awesome in Alpha but I guess the developers sold out themselves..."
"Early Access ReviewI do like this game, but right now it isn't great. Some things are objectively better than others, which makes it almost imposible to win against some other players. From what I can see, this game doesn't have any bugs or glitches or anything like that. I will continue to play with game and I will change my review when they balance the game better. But untill then, I would not reconmend you buy this game."

You won't regret for this!
"Early Access ReviewThis game seemed great, before pvp, that balance! Wow, and different leagues, and just ... just wow! 10 pvp battles not one win, it started out as fun, now im considering just uninstalling this.As an update:I used all the premium currency ... now im winning basically every time ... very much o2w, very bad balance, in other words :/"
"Early Access ReviewI hope they add more content... Like a lot more content.... like atleast 20x what there currently is because at the moment its only fun for about 30 minutes then its boring, would make a really good mobile game though not really my kind of pc game :/ will see what its like after early access though."

"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI don't think I'd recommend the game. Much like hearthstone this game will suffer from stagnation as set strategies emerge as being the best and come to dominate the game. However due to the fact that Minion Masters and this is me making the assumption having a smaller team they simply won't be able to put out new content fast enough to keep the game interesting. I don't see that big of a community forming around this game, especially when it has to compete with so many other more established games. Personally, once I got my achievement whoring out of the way and got the few last achievements I wanted to grab from the game I uninstalled it with out a second though since I found myself simply becoming bored with the game.You can see my full review of the game here: http://thelpq.blogspot.com/2017/06/minion-masters.html."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis is LOOTBOXES AT IT'S FINEST. The devs should be jailed for pushing this on kids. The game lets those who drop hundreds insta win. So In case you're wondering if thats why the game is on the decline thats it. Along with just shoddy programming and half the cards not working correctly. Don't waste your time on this one and think you can buy in like you would do in Hearthstone and have a competitive advantage. YOU CAN'T.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewMinion Masters:~~~~~~~~~~~~  Masters, are you ready? It’s time to choose your deck of cards. What tactics are you going to use? Would it be a defensive or an offensive strategy? What you really need to know is what your opponent’s plan is! Stop speculating, Master, you are about to enter the area. Good luck and I wish you well to lead our minions to victory, my Master!Minion Masters is a PVP / multiplayer game where you compete with other players online to move up leagues! As a newbie, you will be assigned to the Wood League to start. Each league has five divisions. Each time you are victorious, you will be given experience points which will go towards your ranking and therefore move you up divisions within the league.  In the Wood League, for example, you need to reach 100 points to move up a division. You will be given one master as a default, and will have to access two other masters through the free weekly master rotation. As soon as you are ready to battle against an online opponent, just press the play online button to enter the arena. It will not take too long for you to find an opponent. The longest I had to wait was around thirty seconds.Your deck will consist of ten cards. All cards have a number on them. For example, an assassin card has a number four on it. What it means is that you can activate this unit when the mana gauge reaches the number four on its scale. Bear in mind, the highest number on the mana gauge is ten. So if you wait until the gauge reaches ten, you can activate two assassin units (if they are in your deck, of course) and a laser unit, which costs two mana points. In terms of the battle map, you have two sides which are connected with two bridges. The trick is to capture and hold the bridges. If you do so, your mana gauge will rise faster than normal. Also, your master can access peaks faster if you hold the bridges. The goal is to destroy your opponent’s power tower where your opponent master stands to win the game. At the end of a game, you will receive experience points for rising within the league, and also levelling up your character. You might receive coins, shards or rubies.How do you get new units or cards? With tokens! You can purchase tokens with your coins or rubies. Then you can use these token on your power tower to access a random draw; a bit like a roulette wheel. Each card has experience attached to it; it could be a regular, common, rare or supreme card.  The last one has the most experience as a unit.Every twenty-four hours, you will earn a free token. The only difference is that instead of drawing a card, the draw will have coins, shard or rubies for the taking. Oh, by the way, you need shards and rubies to purchase new masters. Graphically, Minion Masters is well done and very easy to understand and get into. The most important point is that you don’t have to wait too long to play a game online. However, I think we need more Masters and map designs.Positives:~~~~~~~  -Great graphics-Good selection of cards-Fun, addictive gameplay-Easy to access a game online-Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -I would like to see more masters to choose from-It would be nice to have different mapsMinion Masters is seriously fun to play and is extremely addictive!8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"Early Access ReviewUpdate 60, ""Hooray Cancer"". killed last 10 people playin it. Minimizing game for mobile devices and calling it ""LOOKS MATTER"" just waaow....Found this game randomly serfing friends profiles and insta dissapeared for weeks in minion masters, thx to last update it turns me back to life. GG DEV's, was good times."
"Early Access ReviewVery nice, this game as a lot of potential. Its enough casual for a quick game and you can feel the deepness of the strategy to come. It feels like a game of hearthstone.  The Meta will fun with this game."
Early Access ReviewThis is an early access title that allows for a ton of microtransaction purchases that lead to it being very Pay-to-Win. You simply can't compete with people who are higher level or have better cards than you. I don't believe the developer has really considered the tuning values of the cards or how the ranked system operates (everyone starts at the bottom).
"Early Access ReviewSo .... A RTS, a MOBA and a TCG decided to hang out one day pretty much enjoying each other's company. Then had a few drinks too many and ended up in bed together. Lo and behold RTS winds up pregnanat and with no way to tell who the actual father is both MOBA and TCG stick around out of guilt to help raise the young 'un. And that boys and girls is the story of Minion Masters conception ...."
"Early Access ReviewReview taken from http://moco.net , Based off 4 hours of play. http://wp.me/p6Upnu-sa-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There’s nothing quite like Minion Masters game play out there, but it does use the currently popular deck building, and earning methods out there. Let me explain, let’s start with the game play. You create your own deck of cards, aka units. In the game four unit cards are presented to you at random. Cards are dragged and dropped onto your side of the battlefield within set space limits, and then the units walk into your opponents area and try to take down their hero. While your opponent is doing the same, your units meet theirs and they battle it out. Cards are set in tiers one through eight, and the higher the tier the longer you wait to be able to summon them. Games are usually take no longer than four minutes with some lasting as little as under two.Minion Masters BattlegroundMinion Masters’ fast paced game play makes it super addictive. Dragging and dropping your unit cards is fun, and watching your units overcome your opponents is rewarding. A deck consists of ten cards, they are labeled from common to supreme I made a themed deck built around buildings, I had a lot of building cards and one card spawned as many minions for as many buildings that I had on the field, it’s a lot of fun toying around with it and tweaking it to your liking. There are also different heroes to choose from, changed weekly. One hero is good at close combat, another ranged, and another with the ability to raise units from the dead. As you play your hero gains experience which unlock abilities. There are also two bridges, once a unit crosses it, your side controls it, which gives you even more experience.The game is generous with giving you free units as well. You gain gold by winning games and one thousand gold gets you one unit, chosen at random. You receive one thousand coins just about every other level. Something I didn’t like was that, you are stuck with one deck until you reach level twenty, then you get two. This just isn’t enough to just make a deck to mess around with, while keeping your serious deck separate.Overall I enjoyed Minion Masters quite a bit and can see myself playing it for some time, I hope it does well."
"Early Access ReviewMinion Masters is a fun strategy game. Developers push weekly updates. A single game typically lasts no more than 10 minutes but it's very addicting. 2v2 mode is awesome. Hoping the devs add 3v3, more maps & modes!"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe summary of this game in short can be put like this: At first it will be entertaining a fun because it is a new game. You will be interested in learning, playing, and even trying to advance your rank. However, after playing for a while and digging deeper into things trying to get better and learning all you can then you will find it incredibly frustrating. The game is very imbalanced. Which if you ever try 'Draft' mode then you will see how random things really are even with good picks.The long list:Solo mode - Solo Play is about what you would expect. It is you versus a computer AI. The computer isn't particularly smart though at times it was kind of hard just starting out and having practically nothing or knowing little about the game. Solo is there to give you a basic education though.. nothing special.""Online"" mode - Technically all of it is online...but whatever. first of this is what the game calls 'ranked' mode. you play and as you win or lose your rank is affected. now here is the issue. there is NO 'casual' mode to play against real players in a non-ranked format. so you are always playing with your rank on the line. its not exactly the most relaxing thing. some people would like to just join a casual game and not worry about wins or losses.Draft mode - This is like 'Arena' format where you get a line up of some random cards and you pick from them one at a time until you have a full deck. As I mentioned before the game is pretty imbalanced and this really comes through when the rng is at its worst...which is here.  In fact I have tried even with really great decks to win as much as possible. the most I have one is 3 out of a possible of 12. It takes 1500 gold to enter after you have grinded it. your reward should you actually win 1-3 is like 1300-1400 gold worth in prizes. you get a power token (1000gold from the store) and around 300-400 gold. i suspect you have to get at least 6+ wins to just break even.Imbalances - So about those imbalances. Just coming into the game recently I was greeted by the ""Call to Arms"" meta. Which is that they dont play much except buildings and more buildings. Then they start spamming you with the spell ""Call to Arms"". Its nearly impossible to beat unless you have a deck specifically dedicated to beating it. Which kind of makes you vulnerable to everything else in the game. It really makes the game a pile of crap at this point in time just by itself.laser turrets are stupid. they can hit both ground and air targets. fire at high speed and the longer they stay on a target the faster they attack as well. they can take down heavy tanks in a second. i mean if they had a vulnerability like they couldnt attack air targets that would be one thing. they have no vulnerability though. worse though is it is considered a ""common"" card. it is so cheap to get these things through crafting anyone can have them.. even the noob. "
"Early Access ReviewSuper fun to battle others online in this Tug-o-War game, which reminds a lot like Clash Royale, but is very different even though. The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale. So if you want to experience a good PC Clash Royale game, I can recommend this one for you :-)"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSo a friend gifted me this game because he said he had an additional key he did not need. At first I was a bit sceptical but tried it anyway. I'm also a great fan of FORCED so maybe the developers turned this game into something great.So I played the game over a couple of days and spent a few hours in it. So here a quick basic review:The gameplay itself is nothing new, you pick a character, pick a deck and then summon minions at some location on your mapside and cast spells with mana in order to defeat the opponent. Mana accumulates slowly over time.Your character also slowly levels and with each level up you get access to special abilities. There are two bridges connecting each map side and controlling them gives bonus exp.The same gameplay already exists since at least one and a half decade and there is really not much difference to other games of the same genre. There are a few twists, which make this game stand out a bit (compared to the 15 years old games I played) and the developers really tried to make the game more strategical, but all in all coming from an RTS and Turn-based strategy background it all feels like luck is involved too much. The right draws at the right time make all the difference in this super-fast paced game (matches often last less than 3-4 minutes).Starting a match with 4 different cards and all of them are either too cost intensive or get hard countered by the opponents spawned minions feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Changing deck setup is also a) ressource intensive as you accumulate new cards/ressources for cards very slowly (or I had not much luck there either with almost only duplicates) or b) every deck can seemingly get hard countered by another deck. Since your opponent will go for a strategy you cannot know before you go into a match, you also have to be a bit lucky to not get wrecked by an opponent with a special strategy you don't know and cards you have no access to yet.Furthermore I have to criticize the ranked system. Apparently every month ranks get reset to Silver 5 as I have been told. I also was sent from Diamond 5 back down to Silver 5. Were before on my climb I was mostly facing people with the same cards I could use and a skill level that you would expect I suddenly face players who have hardcore meta decks and strategies you have to have a counter ready right away. I can only speculate which rank they belonged to before but it certainly wasn't anything below Platinum. Meaning low rank players have to fight high rank players at the start of the season and subsequently get punished for not being as good or invested into the game. They lose rank points and have a hard time climbing back to the rank where they were before the end of the season until ranks have stabilized to some extent.Normally I would rate this game something along the lines of might be fun for certain people, but since there is no neutral or so-so button, I vote it down."
"Early Access ReviewOne of my commenters pointed out a bug in the game at 2:03 minutes into this videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_51R_V33jp8&t=123s A minion should have been hit stunned but wasn't causing me to lose the game, as far as the game goesits alright but I feel like new players vs veteran players is generally a big mismatch, hope the review helps, keep working on it!"
Early Access ReviewHorribly unbalanced game and the pay to win platform gives a definite advantage to those who pay.im not saying its a bad game infact i quite enjoy it however the devs need to balance the cards
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGot the game for free about 2 months ago. Game itself is a generic arena type. 2 lanes and who spawns more wins. It was interesting to play for first 10-20 matches, but got boring affter it. They added in game purchases to buy cards so basicaly you can overpower non-paying players with ease. When the game came out as a release 2nd december, I just wanted to check some reviews. Saw 20e price tag, laughed hard and closed it.Basicly you pay 20e for a generic arena game, with not so big community, and when you get in game, people can pay more. Cashgrab at its finest.-Gameplay-Paied transatcion (p2w)-Overpriced-No tactics just get few  cards that spawn minions and you can easy win"
"Early Access ReviewGot it for free, is it a good game? Why yes, yes it is, however it has it's issues, it is early access after all, the main issue comes from poor balance which should be fixed as it moves closer and closer to a full release.You may be asking what's wrong with the balance? Well an example of that would be rush decks, you basically spam 0-1-2 mana cards doesn't matter which one you put down you just spam them and eventually you'll win the game because of how flooded the board will get, it's impossible to deal with this nonsense which brings me to my next issue, flooding the board, there is no limit on what you can have on the board which leads to big balance issues, I've seen a board get filled with so many buildings there was literally no counterplay, nothing could be done about it.My next issue with balance is spells, spells work on heroes, that seems fine but really it's not, you'd ""I have 100hp but I am holding really well I think I can turn this around"" only to have the enemy fireball your face and then you lose, there is nothing you can do about this.I'm not going to list all the balance issues but this is just a few, this is a solid game it really is but there are so many balance issues it's a pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sometimes, it also has a $5 price tag on a game that should be free to play, the developer said it will be free to play in the future which sounds nice and all but that is so backwards it makes no sense, let me get this straight, it's going to cost money to play the EARLY ACCESS game but free to play when it gets FULLY RELEASED, ok then, that makes perfect sense... No, no it doesn't, the game should be free to play from the moment it's on Steam, period. People that played early access should get those special rewards, don't try and entice with stupid DLC that pay for the game in early access, cut the crap, the people that buy it in early access are buying DLC, they aren't getting anything for free, the developer can call it a gift all they want but the fact is it's not a gift, you are PAYING for it.Bit of a rant I know but it kind of pisses me off when developers try to pull thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ using â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t tactics to entice the player, you're not enticing me, I got it for free, awesome, I would never pay for this game. As for whether you should buy this or not? Well if you want the ""gift"" pfff haha sure go pay for DLC in early access otherwise stay the hell away until this game becomes free to play which is how it should be.I do not recomment it, I will change to recommended when it goes free to play, others may be fine with it but I'm not, it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t tactic that should never have been done like this."
"Early Access ReviewIt's a ""casual"" card game that you actually cannot play casually, as only grinding massively (including in grinding events) will allow you to unlock decent cards."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe game is amazing. All those who complain about it not being ""free to play"" cause you can buy rubies with money and get cards faster are just some cry babies. The game offers you free in game currency when you level your account  when you play online matches or when you do the daily challenges. So far I have seen no bugs and got no disconnects from the server.  The game is very easy to understand and easy to play also a lot of fun."
Early Access ReviewThe #1 Game of all Time!™If you haven't supported the developers yet! You are seriously missing out. This game has the ability to not only get you hooked to play casually but also has massive potential as an e-sport game.I love games that try something new and I will fully support these developers! I hope you all do the same!10/10
Early Access ReviewIts a very fun Game to relax and hear music to it. The only downside is there is a bug (i dont know if its only on my computer) if you click Mouse 1 when the game is loading it crashes. Its a very great game though so its worth the money.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewCompleted the FTP Part of game, got a free pass to try game, Gave it a very fair chanceI am even what many in this genre would consider a whale or at least a hefty buyer, and could have put hundreds into this game (and do to others frequently) if I thought it had a chance to hold a player base and a reasonable way for F2P people to competeRatingPVE Solo Player 4/10  Way too short, perhaps an hour, and I never lost a match, too simple, and NO PVE END GAMEPVP 1v1 Noob    8/10, was only placed against p2w tiers above me maby 25% of the time, and the other 75% of the games I won more often then not vs people with my same cardsPVP 1v1 After first 5 wins  1/10  Your only hope is that some other poor soul out there also has not spent money on the game and you both are bashing your heads against the pay to win wall at the same time and get put together for a good gameDraft ~5/10  Have a chance as decks random, but there is another pay wall to join and competeI have done all the solo quests, I have done pvp enough to get out of first noob bracketI have completed everything so that there are now 2 things left in the game: 1v1 pvp, and draftThe first 2-3 hours of the game nets you enough free coins to pick up about 10 cards on top the starter 10cards (x3 of each), of which every 5th ""roll"" is garanteed at least ""rare.""  Both my garanteed rare rolls got the same unit, which is essentially useless that I have never used.  Apparently you can have up to 3 of each, and cards only give you one when you get them.  I was fortunate enough to pick up a rare in one of the 8 other rolls, ok.At this point I have passed the starter deck players like myself, and am into the pay to win crowd.  I have lost around 12 matches in a row, very fun and competitive( Just Kidding), to players with huge swarms of smalls, only flying minion hands, and rushing hands with special abilities from the commander to enter field and join the fight, as well as minions that rush you main guy and kill him in a min flat.   There are at least 2 tiers Above rare, and you are not going to get them without serious cash.  Also, other ""commanders"" or like that above are not possible to obtain without paying real money, or beating an absurd number of pay to win players in pvp to get the rewards to unlock a single other one, other than the starter guyOk so, can you take a few hits, level up still and get some more cards to compete? Urm not unless you want to spend... a year at it.  12 matches, netted me like 8 gold per loss, and guess what it takes 1000gold to buy a single roll at a single card.  To be fair there are a few ""level"" rewards that give you some free common cards, a daily which can get you a roll (if you say can beat the pay to win players in under 3 min... nope) There is also a crafting system, of which apparently you can craft, and you get some free crafting mats enough to make a common card or two from entering the 2nd pvp tier.  RatingPVE Solo Player 4/10  Way too short, perhaps an hour, and I never lost a match, too simple, and NO PVE END GAMEPVP 1v1 Noob Tier Very fun, was only placed against p2w tiers above me maby 25% of the time, and the other 75% of the games I won more often then not vs people with my same cardsPVP 1v1 After first 5 wins  1/10  Your only hope is that some other poor soul out there also has not spent money on the game and you both are bashing your heads against the pay to win wall at the same time and get put together for a good gameOnly way I see this game working is if they pull the huge grind down to a reasonable level, and try and make money of cosmetics instead of features.  Unfortunately this will take a lot larger player base than this game has.Overall Dissapointed, even as a free game"
"Early Access ReviewI am the swarm master! bwahaha! my low level 2 star monster is basic yes , but they will be cast out as your men prepare to shoot, or right after there swords slash my swarms will pop up! I have invested 0 dollers into this game....and no reason to lie  I won the first 12 games in a row, even came across some scary looking legendary cards! but i beat them with strategy, i dont believe this is a pay to win, its a pay to get more, lets be honest, no matter how much someone pays i will be a strong foe, because you cant pay for skill, and as i have said without paying i have some strong cards, and use the basics to the fullest! I will be.....the very best, the best there ever waaaaas, growin my deck to use it for my caaaause, minion master!"
"Early Access Reviewso this is basically a RTS magic the gathering game. and dont let early access fool you its complete enough to enjoy fully as it is but ive already been pleased with the devs update frequency and content . Anyways,  the most important thing is this game is fun really fun and you dont have to buy anything. though i enjoyed it so much that i decided to support the devs and purchase an account upgarde pack that gives me some extra deck slots and a gold boost. the game play is fast and tactical and is literally summoning creatures that have a preset AI to go out on a two lane battlefield and defend your caster while simultaniously trying to attack your opponents castpor. the matches last for about 2-7 minutes and theres alot of good combo building and deck constructing elements, and it really tempts you to play ""just one more game"" after each match ends. there is a pay element if you want to buy their premium currency but the only thing you can buy with it that you cant get for free is most (not all) of the skins. they really give alot of free stuff starting out and daily (including that premium currency) and i dont think youd ever need to buy anything if you didnt want to and you would still be able to build  several very good decks without having to grind ridiculous hours.  its also got a neat multiplayer team mode that lets you play along with someone else vs another team and its alot of fun to get matched with random people and be able to cordinate with no communication. i really recomend it and think i will be playing it for quite a while.its free!!feels balanced so far and devs seem active and post regular updates and free expansion content.Its really, truly fun with a nice techno fantasy sort of theme (think masters of the universe or maybe thundar the barbarian)game play is intuitive and you can pick it right up without much tutorial game play is quick and match making is good so its easy to get a few games in whenever youve got a couple of minutesthere are lots of game modes and events goign on so there feels like a decent amount to doits free!! so if it sounds at all appealing you should give ti a try"
Early Access ReviewInteresting for about an hour then is just repetitive. Not sure the game is balanced for people starting out vs people that have paid or played to get better stuff.

"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI had the game as giveaway and I've read ""About pricing"", this game is like a mobile game free to play.The game is rapidly boring and multiplayer without interest, it will be pay to win to have best card. Then only a matter of luck to draw good card at good time. For casual gamers only."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewNothing revolutionary, the way the cash shop appears in this state is that it is ""Pay to Win"" in the same sense that Hearthstone or other card style games are, in the sense that you can get all the same benefits, but you can get them with significatnly less frustration and time by paying.wouldn't have paid for it, nor would I suggest paying for it at this phase. if you get the oppurtunity tog et it for free, it's worth a few plays at least, I think it would be much more suited as a mobile game rather than a desktop game."
"Early Access Review0 Wins / 37 LossesWith only about 50 cards to show and people already theory-crafting at the very bottom of the ladder, the game quickly becomes stale as matches are pretty regularly one-sided and based on your opening hand of four cards. It's still in early access, but the game's community and style are already set in stone. Counter, counter-counter, etc. is fun for a few hours, but with such limited options the ""winning formula"" has already been found and shuts out everything else.The game suffers from a SERIOUS snow-balling effect, and given the ""counter this! Counter that!"" style that they're going for in the advertisements, it suffers badly in favor of whoever got the best opening hand.Avoid it for now, maybe they'll rebalance a few things before its full release."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewPersonally. I love this game.Somehow it gives a lot of fun. Looks simple, but it needs a bit of strategy mind to succeed.Devs updating it quite often, so there`s potential. Good job."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewMinion Masters takes the standard pages from your average mobile game. Loot boxes, daily quests, monthly events, the standards. Even though it's still Beta its clear the Devs put a lot of work into it. A lessor developer would have published the current build as finished which does speak well of how clean it looks. Easy interface, simple to learn system, tutorial, a good selection of cards and a decent rooster of possible champions to choose from. (Once you pay in game currency to unlock them that is.) That's not to say it's perfect. There are still glitches and improvements that are needed. You're most common glitch is probably just the quests not being marked when they're completed or the game not being able to register achievements even though Steam marks them down. I've probably gotten dozen of them or so and the bloody ""Unlock 3 achievements"" quest still won't register them. C'est la vie. The game tries it's best to offer lots of different ways to play and experience the game, but it does get repetitive as everything, despite the mode you play pretty much boils down to the same thing over and over again. I guess some people find this fun, but I need a breather from this type of insanity after a short while. Still there is promise of future game modes that may drastically mix things up so I guess that's a good thing, if it follows through that is.Although I'm pretty sure the game is not pay-to-win, there are a number of obvious 'tricks' that are being used to get you to open your wallet. There's a feature in the game called the Battle Pass and this to me... felt like a huge insult to players who don't want to spend more money. You see, like all games like this, they have like ""PVP seasons"" where players can earn ""points"", called Glory in this game, to climb up Tiers and earn extra prizes. Nothing wrong with that. The Tier system is split into two branches, one free and one for those who buy the Battle Pass. (With in-game or real word currency) Again, there is nothing wrong with this. It's normal to offer bonuses to those who are giving you money. Why this bugs me is because the free branch has many, MANY, empty tiers. Hours of game-play to rank up will earn you no reward sometimes for multiple tiers of the pass and earning a rank up can take hours of game-play with ranks needing tens of thousands of points. For a new player you're looking at about 20 points per victory only unless you use the Wild Cards provided to you which rotate out, then about 1000. So a rank up can take about 50-60 matches and without the 400 point Wild Cards, this would be impossible. I'm not crying for rewards equal to those who paid extra, but nothing? Really? Once I realized I was essentially ""spinning my wheels"" I really lost a lot of motivation to play. So yeah, there are a few practices that I don't feel comfortable with. They're not evil choices, like EA, but they are defiantly amoral. Still the game isn't unplayable and does offer a bit of fun. Even if it's not my cup of tea and despite the fact that it feels somewhat unrewarding unless you're willing to shell out extra cash I can see many other people enjoying it. Honestly, I really liked the Commentator. Reminded me a bit of Blood Sport and Rock n' Roll Racing.It still kind of sucks. The fact that I know I'm going to be be static for the next 50 wins, not matchs, playing the same cards over and over again because I litterally have no way to progress outside of pounding my head against the wall pretty much leaves you feeling hopeless and depressed. Maybe there are people who like that. Hmm, pay-to-have-fun. Yeah, that's what this is. I'll leave it a positive reveiw, because there are some people who like this type of game and Minions Masters does deliver it. Can't account for taste I guess."
Early Access ReviewThis a game like Clash Royal without the crap.I honestly enjoy this game so much. I wish there were more cards. And more Masters. But they will get there. Still took me a long time to get most of the cards that i enjoy using themost. Excellent game.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAmazing. I have been playing this since the first Alpha playtest. There is so much starategy to it. Similar to Clash Royale, but it has it's differnces."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA fresh take on the card game genre. Somewhat like when my wife left me for a hunky optometrist. I just ordered a fresh young mail order bride and she's got a better♥♥♥♥♥than my wife ever did. Bit of a mustache though... and this game doesn't have enough cards in it yet... 7/10Thanks for the free game though, really generous of you :D"
"Early Access Reviewp2w, better deck wins simple as that.If you can use real money to get every card and master,  you can have the best combinations on the first day, copy the best players gameplay and go to the top with no effort at all. The game is pretty simple you can only use a few cards per game copy the deck with the highest winrate and do the same thing every game, no point doing different you only lose if you make a mistake or the enemy happens to have specific counter at the right time, which involves luck."
"Early Access ReviewI used to like this game and play a bit every day.The matches were also fast, each match would never take over 10 minutes to end (even in 2v2).Now it seems they did a big update, the arena is much much smaller, the minions are much biggers, and what before used to be an average of 10 seconds for a regular minion to go from 1 corner of the map to the other, now they do that in only 2~3 seconds!!!!I dont understand, but my guess is that they are trying to release this game on mobile and want us to also play a mobile game on PC!!!! What used to be a good game now is total garbage!Right now even battle royal as a much bigger arena size!"
"Early Access ReviewUpdate:This is what happens when devs do not listen players. Check my comment below and you will understand why game is dead now and devs changed it to Free to Play :)I am happy that devs bancrupted, they deserved it.Update:Devs did not fix problems I mentioned few weeks ago. Result? GAME IS DEAD. There are no players and you wait many hours for any battle.This is what happens when devs are greedy and do not listen players.Games was very nice till I reach Diamon +. EVERYONE on high ranks use one skill - Magma Storm. It kills everything on 50% of the screen. So you are against 2 enemiec which give them between 4 to 6 of these skills. From this point there is no more tactic or strategy. It does not matter what will you bring on board. It will die from this brainless skill. Thousand of people claim this issue to devs but they do not respond for this problem.Anyway, all my guild, friends etc stopped play Minion Masters just because it is unplayable on high ranks. Team who spent more USD wins. If you do not spent any dollars you can have zero Magma Storms. If you spent 1000USD you can have 6 of them in your team = easy win.Game Not recommended till Magma Storm (called♥♥♥♥♥♥Storm) issue is solved."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt's like Clash Royale, but sideways and actually good, but sadly this game revolves around getting lucky with loot boxes, and currently certain cards & combos are so incredibly powerful that they let you win the match in less than 20 seconds, so if you didn't get lucky, you would always lose to a lucky player, or a paying player who bought more loot boxes and therefore had the chance to get a better deck than you.At the moment, the game is unbalanced, I suggest waiting a few months for updates before hopping into it. "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewEdit: The community is pretty toxic and awful, the devs stand in support of said toxic crowd, so beware if you can't handle that kind of environment. It is akin to MOBAs and survival games in that regard. The game itself is pretty decent, but the people are awful. On to the original review! TL:DR Definitely worth at least checking out, but don't expect to be competitive without a ton of grinding or dropping real cash.  Minion Masters is basically a Starcraft mini-game with a stand alone client and original art. That's not a bad thing, Starcraft has spawned at least two gaming genres. So on that alone it has potential. Right now some balance issues, but that'd be expected. It also has standard CCG purchases that let real money people assemble a better deck much quicker and easier than grinders. I have not run into lag issues yet, but because of the nature of this game if lag issues pop up it could really hurt the gameplay because a lot of skillful timing is involved, and the gameplay is what is worth checking out the game even if you aren't a wallet warrior. Gameplay consists of summoning units who will automagically fight your battles for you, or cast effects on the field. Basically a card battle without the waiting."
"Early Access ReviewI REALLY enjoy this game.  However, why are you trying to squeeze me for every penny when I ALREADY BOUGHT your game?  I just don't understand developers who lure you in with a decent price for a new game and BAM right hook to the face, pay us more money to unlock the FULL game.  #ModernDayMafia*UPDATE*Put a few more hours into the game.Good money for each game completed, however is it "" several thousand gold PER DAY.""  No, not unless you're a low level getting prizes for each level unlocked and/or spending hours on this.  It's 1000G for 1 spin of the wheel which also has duplicates of cards you already have unlocked.  Depending on the day you can end up getting quite a few duplicates.  Let's not forget to mention Rubies and Shards, yes they give you quite a substantial amount on loadup.  There's also going to be new masters, cards, maps, etc.  WHICH cost rubies.  Goodluck buying those without dropping more cash.  AND no you can't afford all the Arena Maps and Masters from start.  Once again........#ModernDayMafia*Caution - Kids have found Reddit deck building guilds and are in full force."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is really fun. It does not feel like a mobile game when playing despite what other reviews might suggest. It is similar in ideas to clash royale but this game is much more thought out and beautiful in comparison.
"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, this game is lit.the graphic is so damn nice even its set on low qualityim not into this kind of game, but minion master is enjoyable for meyou guys should play this game if you guys r bored to play anything "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTL;DR: The gameplay gets boring and same-y; you could play half a dozen matches and essentially get the feeling of every match you'll ever play. The card system is just a grind for the current best cards. Current ""best"" decks make competitive play a boring, stagnant mess based on RNG because the game requires very little skill.The gameplay itself isn't bad, but it's shallow. The game boils down to picking a card to play and playing it on a location. There are spells and minions. Minions can be flyers (making them invulnerable to ground melee units), buildings (meaning they're stationary and lose health over time), or building-focused (they ignore other minions except buildings). Spells are all variations on temporarily or permanently removing minions from play; some require basic MOBA-style targeting skills to use effectively.Masters are the avatars you can choose to play as. Each has its own attack style (for defending itself when minions reach your end of the board) and special abilities (cards that are mixed into your deck, or passives) that are unlocked with in-match experience.The board itself has two bridges (which give experience to the master of the last minion that walked/flew over them), a gap in the middle that flying units can bypass.Each minion has its own quirks in addition to basic types (flying or not, etc.), but it feels like some are far more viable than others. This is given evidence by the dominance of successful builds used by top players— leaderboards can be dominated by a single deck until a new patch arrives. Which leads me to my next point...Deckbuilding is the only thing giving this game any longevity besides its competitive leaderboards (which can be meaningless due to the current dominant deck). You earn pitiful amounts of gold by winning matches, significant amounts by doing daily quests (ex: win X times), and pitiful amounts of shards (card crafting ""dust"") by gaining more than 3 copies of any card. As far as I'm aware, the third resource, rubies, is limited to a few handouts that every player will quickly receive via achievements (ex: reach X competitive tier). Gold is used to buy tokens for a single random card, massive amounts of shards can be spent on new masters, boards (just graphic changes to your side of the board), and cards, rubies are used for masters and boards.PVE is just a set of matches against bots. You receive set rewards for beating each bot match once. This was a major disappointment to me— I enjoyed the randomization and depth of Forced Showdown."
"Early Access ReviewI don't know if it is my laptop, but I feel like the game is so laggy and slow. Maybe 30-40 fps. I play many games and I get 60+ fps CS:GO, Dota 2, etc.It costs $20, AND pay2win. wow.I'm new to the game and still discovering it tho."
"Early Access ReviewThis game is basically Clash Royale with hero avatars, so a bit like Clash Royale meets HearthStone I guess. It plays a lot like Clash Royale but there are two bridges in the game you need to control, the longer you have them under your control the more exp you get which enables your hero to do get some skills. IMHO it's a vast improvement over the Clash Royale game because each hero you has a a distinct playstyle, this leads to a lot of varieities in decks you play against. One thing I don't like though is deck slots are locked till lvl 20, it's a pain to make decks or search for the card you want.I find the business model to be both fair and a bit unsatisfying. On one hand you get a pack a day, there is dust to craft cards you need and there is a ""free rotation"" on heroes. On the other hand though, the ""pack"" is really just one card so buying power stones isn't that satisfying, once you have a decent collection good luck getting new cards as you will just get duplicates which will get dusted. I bought 10 power stones and got dust and a crappy card.  Another thing is you still need to buy heroes separately, of course you can also grind for it using freemium currency but this game isn't exactly free to play so why are we paying more stuff for heroes? If this is the business model then just make it F2P outright, they have a promotion giving out free steam keys for people following their newsletter which essentially makes this game free, but for the average Steam player who has no idea there's such a thing he'll be paying for the game, and then pay for it again in micro transactions. At least right now though paying $13 gives you the Premium upgrade for free so you're getting something for your money and players who didn't get a free steam key don't feel like they got ripped off. Even with these gripes though the game is still pretty good and addicting, I find it to be much improved version of Clash Royale both in mechanics and business model. I highly recommend it.  "
"Early Access ReviewReally cool game. However, it is basically a copy paste of assets from previous BetaDwarf games and gameplay from the many SC, WC3, SC2 maps that came before it. I really tried to like it. You get further and just get dominated by some crazy rare card that you don't have. I wanted something more like DOTA/LOL/DOTA2 where each summoner has there own deck so you can't just pay to win everything. I cannot say I am an expert at this game, maybe it is more balanced once you own everything. Unfortunitly, I am an adult and don't have the time. So I am moving on."
"Early Access ReviewOne of the best games in the world. In this game, the time you summon a monster or you use a spell card,  it appears in the field to fight for you. This feature is not yet available in all of the cards games, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or others, that what makes it the best cards game in the world, and Hearth Stone comes after."
"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, I got the game from the humble monthly, take that as you will.The game does not seem to be P2W to the degree as others claim. I do have the premium update from the bundle, but it only makes things slightly faster. Mostly the leveling. The double gold from matches, while nice, doesn't feel like a huge advantage, as the majority of your gold comes from daily quests, and those are rather generous. The daily quests I got so far always gave me enough gold for 1-3 new card packs. With this in mind, as far as acquiring cards go, at the moment it is far less pay to win than other games out there. Legendaries are also not hopeless to get at all, and assuming you get some cards that work well together, they are not even mandatory. (Up to a certain point I guess, you are unlikely to be the best there is without a highly optimised deck in such games.)You really do need to have a well-built deck to get anywhere though. If you are just using random cards without a gameplan in mind, it can feel like a hopeless slugfest.It should also be noted that while there are always free heroes available, and you get a perfectly usable one for free, they seem rather hard to unlock for F2P players, and a deck that works well with one hero, might not do so well with another. That is really my only criticism, and to be fair, the developers do need to make a living here. As someone who played Clas Royale but wasn't going to drop a fortune on it, I find the game (at least its current iteration) highy enjoyable, and much less grindy."
Early Access ReviewThe potential of this game is beyond any similar game but with allot more to it. it removes the pay to win♥♥♥♥♥♥ and adds Play to win! masterfull! stay play to win devs! and you will go far!
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI was one of the first who got this Game for free to help with the bugs and testing the game, the deal was to sub the newsletter and then get a 20â‚¬ worth key for the main game, help fixing a few bugs, testing online matches and so on, it was a limited time offer. A few weeks before releasing the game in EA, they did the same offer again but this time without beta testing the game, and with the deal sending keys on release out, what they did. also you get the game now free from alienware. (level 2 or higher needed https://eu.alienwarearena.com/ucf/show/1227282/boards/contest-and-giveaways-global/Giveaway/minion-masters-steam-key-giveaway)Today the Game was released as Early Access Version with a premium DLC who cost for beta testers the same money as for peoples who are buying it right now. No that this is only an EA it also has a overpriced DLC for peoples who helped them, the lie in my eyes was, that they said ""you will get as beta tester the game for free"", sure you don`t need the DLC who gives the game a P2W feeling, but its still a lie, the main game cost 16â‚¬ with DLC and peoples who helped has to pay the same just to get the P2W DLC, same is for peoples who sub a few weeks ago, but at least they didnÂ´t support the game before like many others did. The Game works good now, it still has a few bugs, a short single player story and an open multiplayer where you can play agains other player, it makes fun for a while, and its better then expected but I think it will go soon F2P because the DLC already gives player a P2W change by geting more money, more xp, more rublies to buy arenas, cards and monsters for 1 year. if you got this Game for ""free"" try it, play it, enjoy it as long as you can, because it will not take long untile the game will be unfair with all this pw2 items. And if you where a Humble Monthly Sub you already got the game+dlc in december. So it will fast be hard as not premium user to play a funny online match.thumbs down for p2w in a game who cost 20â‚¬ (after the 20% off). Oh and I would still vote this game negative even if I got the DLC as well, because this DLC ruin the game in every mod."
"Early Access ReviewMinion Masters - Forced to Duel -> more like ""Forced to Pay""The good:- very nice and polished look- cool unitsThe bad:- unbalanced- tries too hard to be different- some bad mechanics- greedy pay model- huge grindI wish they would have stuck to the good old card game formula we all know with this one. The polished look is something I find missing in most other card games out there and I would be so hooked on this if it was just like any other card game - turn based and without a battlefield that units move around on.However they tried too hard to make something different. Nothing feels natural, the slowly regenerating mana bar, the two bridge set up that allows whoever holds them to gain abilities for their hero unit, the placing of units on the battlefield. It feels like a bunch of different mechanics thrown together without them really fitting together. My biggest gripe with the game is how hectic is and that you can't control your units. The unit ai is pretty dumb, often you will see your units stuck on an enemy they hardly deal damage to while another enemy they could have easily defeated picks them off one by one. The developer says this is a game mechanic that the players need to learn but to me it was nothing but frustrating and didn't add anything to the strategic layer of the game. Talk about strategic, I think the developer tried to make it count where and when you place your minions and to a degree it works but the game is just too hectic and the battle fields are too small for this to really work. For example your units can be attacked by the enemy while they are still spawning, so you are forced to think about where to place your minions. The problem is that the battlefield is just way to small for this, which makes enemy minions reach your hero too fast and gives you too little room and time to properly do attack routes for your minions. And don't get me started on the pay model. It's insanely greedy. You earn between 5 and 30 gold pieces per match depending on if you win or not. It takes 1000 gold to roll for another card. You will often roll a card you already got multiple times. There are several currencies, shards, gold, candies... experienced f2p game players will know this is all to make you pay for the game. I think we all know these kind of ""free to play"" games by now that are addicting but only enjoyable if you pay. I don't think I really need to explain this further, it's not f2p done right.Over all I can't recommend this game. The developer tries to bring in new strategic layers to the existing card game formula but at the same time takes away on the strategy part by not giving you control over your units and basically turning the game into a hectic clickfest that is normally decided by how lucky your card draw is."
"Early Access Reviewive put a decent amount of time into this game and I can say i really enjoy it. i regular battle is addicting and fast paced. a tactical card game using minion synergy as well as card synergy with the master you use. 9 unique masters right now all vastly different play styles. i wait less than a minute per a match and i am ranked plat and i have half the cards and a legendary i dont use.  the game also has a lengthy tutorial/challenge which will teach you how to play the game and it will give you rewards as well. daily achievements will give you at least 1000 gold which will give you a power token which unlocks a card. if you dont play every day you should have a max of 3 daily quests that would be 3 power tokens, its not hard to unlock cards. also they give you free tokens every so often. every time you get a token you get shards. these shards are able to get you more cards. on top of that you have achievements i believe there are 30 of them each achievement will give you gold, shards, or rubies. so you can get more cards!. shards and rubies can be used to get masters as well so if you dont want to use rubies or shards use gold you get from leveling up. everytime you level up you get 1000 gold or shards or rubies or an arena skin. mostly 1000 gold. so getting cards is actually really easy to do. the team battle however has  match making problems. If you que solo i wouldnt recommend that. you could be silver and a get a wood tier team mate. I believe the intention was for you to have a friend and que up together which should make it alot more balanced. the game play for teams is still alot of fun but you do need someone to coordinate with you.a lot of negative reviews say this game is pay to win. i dont think its any different from the way hearthstone maybe pay to win or the card game magick , or gwent. ive seen experienced players on stream using the start deck and make it too masters. one of the strongest masters is the free one to start with, that shows that it is a lot of part skill and knowledge not so much the cards.there are constant updates that keep the game fresh. you dont have to pay for the battle pass to get the cards, you just get less opprotunities to get them . its 10 US dollars for a battle pass there have been two i believe that is a reasonable price for the rewards provided and it helps the devs keep on bring out new content by buying it. like i said i dont think this game operates any different from other card games. alot of the negative reviews are from people with less  than a hour or a couple hours on the game. this game is awesome, play it"
"Early Access ReviewThe concept of Clash Royale just bigger and better. No P2W, active developers, lots of unique cards and an ever changing meta. I recommend getting this very very much. The only permanent upgrade which is 20€ goes sometimes on sale for 10€ is not required at all, but grants one tons of currency and it's nice to support the devs.I really don't know why I ever put up wt cash royale lol"
"Early Access ReviewTo start I got this game as part of the December 2016 Humble Monthly.  So, it's not one that I would have normally picked up, but I'm happy to give my review.  To start the game is fun.  It's like a real time strategy meets deck building game.   You build a deck You get a small random portion of your deck given back to you as a hand You generate mana to buy the cards in your hard You hand keeps getting re-filled with random cards from your deck as you buy them You can space the cards (units, spells, buildings) where you want Goal is to beat up the other player's Base / Captain / Hero, while not getting yours beat upIt reminds me of Hearthstone mixed with a MOBA.  Overall much more enjoyable than I would have thought, and certainly worth picking up on sale.  I think the current game feels a bit too ""free to play"" for the price, but on sale (or if it ever goes FTP) it's solid fun with good multiplayer. It was fairly stable except when I left for a few hours and came back.  It seemed to have logged me out in the background and I didn't get credits for games I won.  An enjoyable early access game, and probably a great fit for anyone who likes deck building type games."
"Early Access ReviewFast paced and easy to learn. It's great for short sessions though not too sure of it's payment method at the moment. For some context, I got this game from the Humble Monthly Bundle like what I assume a good few others.GameplayIn short it's a tower defense game with cards as your attackers. You can choose a hero to play which give certain abilities or buff as the round progresses. You send out troops that take control of the bridge between you and the opponent to gain exp for your hero. Your goal is to manage to break though your opponents defenses and have your troops attack the enemy's hero. The stronger the card, the more the cost to use them. From what I can tell from my a bit over a hour play, it's kinda balanced. They set you up with a few challenging solo enemies at the start which after defeating a few, gives you a reward of having a chance to get better monsters. My time in online play was pleasing as well. I lost but the reasoning why I lost was easy to understand. You see, the hero he got is able to to revive monsters after he gets enough exp to do so. He's monsters were mostly low in cost and they eventually out numbered me and soon enough out powered me. I was able to put up a fight for a while but in the end, my lack of realization for his plan cost me and I lost the game. Yes, I lost... by getting Zerg rushed. It was interesting to see what other strategies can come about with similar monsters but a different hero. All in all, a fun game.RNGSo where does the RNG fall in? Well mostly in the card you can draw in. As far as I can tell, they don't seem too unbalanced since the stronger monsters are harder to bring out anyway. I guess an issue you can face is that if you need a type of monster (ranged, melee, or building) it's up to RNG to decide it for you. There are some RNG in the rounds themselves though but only a minor one. Most the monsters you summon. Like mentioned before, there is the use of card. A bad hand can give you a bad day but it's also how you utilize your monsters and how you set up your deck.Micro-PaymentsSo like I mentioned before, I got this on a bundle. So you view on it price-wise is a little biased. That said, for a game you pay for it, seems to rely a bit on micro-payments. As of writing this, the game is on early access so I don't know if it will stay this way or the game will become a free to play later on but at least if you got it around the time I wrote this review, you get a free DLC which gives you a lot of the paid currency and some boost in exp and such. The amount given is quite a lot and you can easily purchase a hero you like, a map/arena you like and even some chances to get some new monsters. I haven't the need to use any of the paid currency at this time and the card and the heroes on rotation seem to do me alright. So as of now, the payment method is particularly unfair but it is something you should consider when buying this game. ConclusionThe game is fun. Nothing about it is too offensive, it seems balanced and the strategies you can utilize make it a challenge in higher levels. It's pretty cheap as well though depending on how the developers go through the game (making f2p or keep their current model) it might be fair to consider a price drop before making any rash decisions. All in all, not bad."
Early Access ReviewAnother early access game with potential that will be dead on arrival because no one cares about early access multiplayer games after they have released due to the hype being completely gone or dead by that point.
"Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewif you know a mobile game titled Clash Royale, this game is very similiar to that, but in this game there is no unit upgrading which really alleviate the pay to win aspect of the genre itself.and there is a shard system in this game, similiar to other card games, you can craft new cards or upgrade your card to promote it to increase it's Glory* and Wild Card Slots(you can add the same card to your deck max 3).*Glory is basically your card's XP which increases your battlepass XP gained after a win(which im not going in too deep cause i don't want to type any longer)the other great and unique aspects of this game are gameplay and Masters/Hero, there are 9 masters right now, each with different skills. In the match, players are consistently fighting for the control of the two bridges which will give extra Masters XP to the one's controlling them(you will still get Masters XP even without bridges but it will be slower), and each masters has 3 levels, with each level up you will unlock a new stronger skill, which means more fun!!the downside is, you have to buy masters to play them unless they are on a free week(2 masters each week) and you have to buy them with shards or ruby both are much rarer than gold.but if you like this genre but feels like it's not fair in the mobile, definitely play this game 100%.Edit: after playing for a few hours i can say that this game's level of generosity towards players that don't want use microtransaction is worst than other F2P card games.1. after the first hour, i never felt like i was rewarded for playing this game for longer than 30 minutes, after i finished the daily quest and opens the battlechests, the game only rewards me miniscule amount of gold for winning a game, Gwent for example does this job very well, where they give players a great amount of loots for playing the game for a longass time(and it's free btw).2. the fact that players can only buy 1 masters early game and can't hope to get anymore unless they pay for it, or pray to the lady luck that you get good cards so that you can compete in mayhem to get some rubies, and this is a GRINDDDD since player only get 15 rubies for 6 wins.all and all, the game isn't exactly pay to win, but the game do try hard to feel like it does, and that's one of the reason that new players don't stick, because they will forget about the game when the game have 23 hours of downtime before giving players free stuff again and the game doesn't reward players for their effort."
"Early Access ReviewThis game is really bad. It's a clone of clash royal and even the units are the same, the only thing about it is that its worse and the units look a little diffrent, buy blood and bacon or reigns i'd buy if i were you and and there like 1-3 buxs"
Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewgood gameEDIT POST:Game is now a slow grind for cards. being forced t odo there extra features just to earn gold.the Expiditions are great dont get me wrong but being forced into doing them to get gold is a stupid idea. most people play this game for the pvp side rather than have an Energy like system to grind for gold. even then not guarenting the cards that they will receive.
"Early Access ReviewCrash, crash, crash, play this game and see it crash is the normal thing with me. 90% I quit my game because of its crash. Even when I let the setting is lowest, I've play so many other games and just that♥♥♥♥♥♥keep crashing and never stop. I lost so many battle and lost EXP just because this game stoped working when I'm in a battle. Fix your problem or maybe many bad review will show up soon!"
Early Access ReviewNothing special to add to this genre. Fun for a short time before the game is giving you no option but to pay up or play a tedious amount of games daily. I say tedious because there comes a point you are just losing to a endless stream of people who clearly just spent money and have great cards. You can never really progress... you can only hover at the same level. Wins come when you play a fair game against someone with equal power card wise and you'll have to play a few games where you are destined to lose to get to those.I got it with extra in game currency in a Humble bundle and thats the only way id have ever tried it. Really not worth any money at all... kind of disappointed I even bothered playing it for as long as I did.
"Early Access Reviewthis game is awesome and i just can't close it but unfortunety this game close it in his own . every time i tried to play with my friend , dual with another online member , went to expedition , changed to good or gorgious video settings and then iam angry with devlopers like hulk smash it on their faces for making awesome game with ♥♥♥♥ing crash and crash and crash  all the time pls do something man i like this game a lot spended more then 60 hours in just single battles only if this game fixed then who know i can spend hours more then csgo ... !!! pls fix it and recomend to all dota nad paladin players :P"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFantastic game for the first 10 hours or so. But then it quickly becomes more and more frustrating as you fine tune your deck and realize this is just another version of the old rock paper scissors gameplay. There are not very many cards and the standard ""meta"" type gameplay. Balance does not seem to matter in games anymore. There is this illusion of skill, but in reality you are just kinda watching some graphics flash around your screen until someone wins. You can EASILY predict who that winner will be within the first 10-15 seconds of gameplay, as once the upper hand is gained the game is over *shrug*I LOVE the concept and idea of this game and hopefully as it develops further it will improve, but as it stands right now it's way fun at first, as you climb the league ladder though.....be ready to lose every time to someone that has either spent money on it or has played much longer than you. Nothing you do can change it either....as there is very little skill involved with this type of game. Thanks for the free copy though! I bought another copy for my 12 year old son *shrug*"
"Early Access ReviewGame is dead. Move along, there is nothing here to see. Whatever is left of it is a bunch of ugly, balding foreigner streamers and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ developers that made it."
"Early Access ReviewPro:Reminds me of old Castle Fight map for Warcraft IIIMixed with board game hearthstone..FunGoreGraphicsSteam inhouse streaming on touch-devices work perfectlyCon:Only 1vs1Limited card number available for nowShopsystem where you nearly get to 2000 shards you need for realy strong cards, scrap cards for around 25 shards takes forever.Premium DLC for 20 Bucks.Season Pass DLC also charged for.small playground since some update.So for some hours of funny castle bashing or getting pwnd under 2mins it's quite joyfull allready, if you dont mind that the grind is real it realy starts to get competetive after you reach silver league.Also if the developers decide to increase the board a bit and create some gamemode with more players this could be realy funny for long term expierence.The developers meanwhile added a 2v2 gamemode which is pretty awesome, and a adventure gamemode where you have some boardgame type of game and participate against bots which is not my thingy but I guess there are people who like playing against bots solostyle but stuff like shrinkening the playground in all games and adding premium system, seasson pass that you have to rebuy pretty fast is not my thingy.. Game still makes fun, but DLC systems make me sick and the reduced size is kind of a slap in the face to pc. Also I read some people have problems with ranking duo to all people start from silver every season again they often face to hard enemies inside their quees (can just tell yes we start from 5, but not sure if people get frustrated when we win in 1:37min)Another thingy is you cant copy over a deck you already created which is kinda sad since you have so many deck slots and often just want to exchange like 3 cards but dont want to forget what your old deck was like it's kind of an issue..Still if you are not going to buy the dlcs and have some time grinding, you can make pretty op builds from quite basic cards which is still funny after so many hours, so buying the game is still worth it tho. Also I bareley meet an early access witch is this smooth which is great."
"Early Access ReviewI bought the game when it was on sale as a meme as some of my frineds had bought it as a meme as well previously my mindset starting it was ""oh its just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ clash royale ripoff"" but this is actually really fun and in my opinion a better game than cr"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewVery fun, if you like deck building games or have even rage quit one so you are looking for something similar but still more skill oriented this is it.Combat is pretty cool, the game tends to reward you a lot for playing it regularly, the 2v2 is also nice + when you buy the game you get a free copy to gift to a friend.Very recommended"
"Early Access ReviewOK so this is my 3rd time editing the review, this time changing the negative review to positive.In my last review I mentioned that the game has a great future and is a great concept but it was very unbalanced and needed some fixing instead of upgrading particle effects and stuff.And the developers fixed it, the game got much much better, they added new modes which solves the main problem of tryhards they got more generous to the players and let them get hardly obtainable items easily obtainble and so on. But obviously there still are problems which they're working on, the developers are doing pretty good I'll be honest The problems are: the player base if you and your friend are searching at the same time you could even meet them but they're doing a lot of giveaways to  get a legit playerbase, also supporting twitch streamers to promote the game and so on. Also another problem is deck building, it's really hard to build a stable deck, over updates a lot of cards get nerfed and buffed, you need to be able to stand everything: giant 1 unit cards, hordes, flying units, long ranged units, etc.The game does have a high price for what it is but it's practically free, you can really easily get it from a giveaway and there's always at least one Minion Masters giveaway at a time. So I suggest giving the game a go, if you're into strategy and planning and stuff, it's really fun and competitive, it's free after all and it's really fun with friends and they're gonna release 2v2 any time soon so it'll be great to play with friends."
"Early Access ReviewBetadwarf has put a great DCCG together. Totally worth getting in early access. This is actually a good game, it is fast and has responsive units with depth to them. It depends where you place, when you place, what you place. There are counters to everything. So, although in the beginning it feels like premium cards carry games on their own, you'll quickly discover weaknesses and ways to play around them. This depth creates great flux in the meta, a meta you can easily follow as all the decks are visible in the top score list. There are always different masters and different decks in the top, there is no oppressive meta or oppressive deck. It's easy to develop your own playstyle and add your own twist. On top of that it has different play modes that require different tactics, great replay mode, PvE content, 9 totally different heroes and some 120 cards already. Active player base, competitve scene, regular scheduled updates.  "
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is really cool. While it's only in an early development stage it has decent graphics.What I really liked about this game is the short game sessions it offers- each game goes on for about 3-5 minutes making the game enjoyable even for short periods of time.I reccomend this game indeed :-)
"Early Access Reviewwas really surprised about this game,fun to play but idk if ill ever be able to ""git gud"" pretty,fun,its not as toxic as league.just enjoy it.can be played comfortably from the couch.id reccomend this to someone wanting to pass time."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSome say this is good.. well I disagree. I easily lost 3 Multiplayer games in a row, due to people who I believe are hackers. So my advice? Don't buy this & get a better game. It's not worth the money."
"Early Access ReviewI..just don't know.The IDEA is neat. It reminds me of the old Magic: The Gathering: Duels Of The Plainswalkers game on PSX. You summon your monsters when you ahve mana, and they walk across the field. If they run into an enemy, they attack it.If not, they attack the enemy summoner.The problem lies in the fact that you have ZERO control of what your Minions attack.Or what YOU attack, for that matter.I have seen games lost because 'You' attack the GIANT, 1000 HP minion doing 3 damage, and ignore the 5 smaller minions that doe bigger damage but die in one hit.So 'You' sit there, forced to attack the big guy while any smart player would smash the little guys first.Sure, you can summon minions near the smaller enemies and HOPE they attack them, or cast a spell IF you have one in your deck and IF you have the mana for it.Too random to fele like you won or lost via skill, that.Plus, the Archer you start as gets 'Global Range' when he levels up..which means he starts attacking the enemy Summoner if there are no enemy minions in play.That's free damage the enemy Summoner cannot block, dodge, or divert. A bit OP, if you ask me.Sorry, the idea is good but overall, this game is..lackluster, dull, and not well balanced.You just summon AI-controlled minions with QWER until someone wins. It's about as fun as an idle or clicker-game, only multiplayer."
"Early Access ReviewOverall 9/10This game draws you in with fun Voice overs and strategic placement of cards. The brilliant thing is most cards serve a purpose of some sort, even if they are commons. and although Legendaries are very difficult to obtain, they are by no means necessary, and plenty of strategies don't include them at all. Thanks to the Ladder system, you are unlikely to be placed against opponents that are vastly superior to you, and allows for time to get a feel for how the game works and what strategies you like.Pros:- Very Strategic in placement and timing- Cards work as intended- Building your own Deck Strategies is fun- Events are commonplace and bring a sense of communityCons:- Major Strategies of the Top players are usually the best, although the timing and placement of those strategies is still the game changer.Overall This game is very fun, and should easily bypass the Price:Time Played ratio. Give it a try, and be the Master to your Minions."
"Early Access ReviewReally enjoying the game so far, currently it's in a semi-closed beta (it's quite easy to aquire a key) and will be f2p on release; the $20 buys premium for a year and isn't required to play.It's a tactical game that requires timing and precision, and is just fun to watch in general. It's kind of like a real-time version of Hearthstone in terms of tone, bright and fun but gory.I see at least one review talking about connection issues, I haven't experienced any issues since I started playing a few days ago."
Early Access ReviewThe game is decent and honnestly it is preety well made  and I think it is an experience that is worth trying. It did not catch me however if you like clash royale or games like that you might start loving Minion Masters.
Early Access ReviewThe Clash Royale of monday night combat.-Simple to understand but complex mechanics(strategy)-Extremely Competetive-Balanced afGet this if you like games that are competetive.
"Early Access ReviewOkay, have to update my review of this game again. Its like the 5th time or so. Gameplay is good and fun. I have become addicted to this game. 2 vs 2 adds alot.  It would be nice, to get all the cards with one price. If that is added later, that would be great. Rush decks have been changed, cards in general are  changed(not nerfed into oblivion like other developer handle such things) regulary.Lots of problems have been addressedOverall positiveI left the bad things in my old review that still stand. Deleted the outdated problems.Old review:In short:If this wasn't free to play, it could have been good.Its extreme slow in getting new cards after the initial phase.And you need a good pool of cards to stopp different decks.Problems:1: Slowness of getting new cards:1000 Gold per Card. a won match is 8 Gold (with premium upgrade 16 Gold). Losing gives like 4 Gold. O.Odaily quest give you one card. Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.The other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.Also you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer. In the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches. Then it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.Why losing a lot of times? See point 2"
"Early Access Review[DISCLAIMER: I received this game for free by registering my email on the dev's homepage.]TLDR:A spin on the known Clash Royale formula, featuring FORCED-style design. Overall good game, at times frustrating due to RNG.Description:""Minion Masters - Forced to Duel"" is a Clash Royale-clone with toned down P2W, due to the removal of unit levels. Matches spawn about 3-4 minutes, though can be over drastically faster or slower, depending on the decks of both players.A deck contains a total of 10 cards, those can  be either minions, buildings or spells. Each card in a deck needs to be unique, though you have two ""wild cards"" - each allows you to use an additional copy of an included card. allows you for example to use 7 different cards and 3 times the same, 6 differents and two times two copies of a card. (You do NOT need to use the wild cards, however I would recommend it)The addition of a commander unit makes this even more diverse - at any given time you have access to at least three commanders, one of the being the one you start with and an additional two which are free to play for a limited time.Interesting is that you can unlock everything (aside of a premium account which increases your XP gain after each match, doubles received gold for one year among things) without spending cash, including alternate arena skins.PROS:+ No need to spend cash for any kind of content+ Constant balancing, preventing single cards from being overpowered+ ""Wild Card"" system gives an interesting spin to the deck building+ Comfortable match length of just 2 - 5 minutes at average+ Variety of cards+ Commander-system allows for additional customization+ Basic cards are not useless, some of them are even competetive staples+ Daily free token can give you some of the cash currency, without the chance being totally BS+ Daily missions allow for fast cash...CONS:- ... but aside of those and the achievments it is very grindy to buy new cards, which makes progressing a chore at times- If RNGsus doesn't like you, this game can be incredibly frustrating- In comparission to other CCGs the learning curve is very hard on you- Some strategies are less viable because there is no commander who really would support them, making them significantly weaker- You cannot chat freely, rather they gave you Hearthstone emotes (I hate that. CCGs are games which invite you to socialize, something you cannot really if all you got are emotes)YOU PROBABLY WILL ENJOY THIS GAME, WHEN:..... you look for a short time diversion... you don't really plan on playing it all day long to unlock everything ASAP - sometimes it is best not to play for a day or two so you have more missions to complete (you can save up up to 3 dailies at a time).... you should generally like CCG/gacha games.... you don't mind a certain level of competetiveness."
"Early Access ReviewSo... I Just got this game, tried it out... It seems interesting to me, but...Why the hell shall I pay for a game 5€ and then, to access its content, I shall invest in ruby or shards or whatever it is called?? Why implement the free2play system in a PAID GAME?? Are you freaking NUTS? It's like buying a flight ticket, and if I want to sit I have to pay more... You guys took greedy to a whole new level..."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewNice tower defense pvp game with cards. Similar to Clash Royale but without the pay to win aspects. Balance seems a bit off, legendaries can easily carry. Good starting point for the game though. Also nice having it for free from Bundle Stars :)"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is not p2w. Seriously. You can get all cards you want by just playing. Surely you need normal hands and some brains (those who state of p2w game have lack of it).Lots of updates.Game is pretty fun and various, Maybe the only ""-"" is optimisation"
Early Access ReviewThe game has been a blast for me so far. After 3 hours of gameplay I can safely say that I will continue playing this game as it is casual and competitive at the same time.
"Early Access ReviewI am not the PVP type of game player, but this was fun. after about 16 hours my  RPG / strategy  exp had me unstopable but for players in the top most ranks. It lost its shine. It is worth a play. Card decks style game comes to life with RTS."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe game is good. The game is very good in fact. Do you enjoy the call and response of checkers and the mana dependant cardplay of Hearthstone? This game is for you then. As a plus, the game is not at all pay to win, with there being no ""End All Be All"" card, just good decks; and its also pretty easy to get new cards regularly. I for one have not spent a single cent on the game (thanks Humble Bundle) and have had lots of fun playing both solo and with freinds.On a sidenote for those complaining about how Legendary cards are overpowered and need to be used if you want to win: Get Good. Its a card game and not ♥♥♥♥ing pokemon. I have chewed up legendary decks for breakfast using only common and rare cards, and hell; I dont even own a legendary and I have had no trouble countering them. Use strategy not brute force."
"Early Access ReviewClash Royale but more pretty, better community, not pay to win and just all around much more fun. I'm leaving CRL for good for this game I have very high hopes for these wonderful developers."
"Early Access ReviewLooks like a phone game ported to PC. This game need a fast forward option, the action happens to slow & i have no patience for it. Looks good & fun but need lot of improvements!After played like 20+ matches online i can say that matchmaking is terrible, i won just 3 of those matches while getting my base nuked by pro players vs. newcomers, so league thing sux to.Also, since is on Steam every game should have Steam achievements, no idea how i missed that to see... maybe in future!"
"Early Access ReviewJust a trash game that's labeled RTS but is actually a card game under that RTS tag.Borderline pay2win because some legendary cards are disgustingly hard to counter it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ not worth playing. Want to play a mechanics based RTS? Just stick to starcraft, this game isn't a REAL RTS."
"Early Access ReviewOverall I think this is a really good and even with the small amount of hours I have on it it has to be a favourite of mine personally, although I personally also uninstalled it too!Pros:-Free!(Everybody loves free stuff)-Unlike say League of Legends and Dota 2 it's all on yourself if you downgrade on a rank-Games are way shorter compared to League and Dota 2-You can put a lot of investment in increasing your rank, collecting cards, collecting all masters, and arena themes etc.Cons:-If you rages easily like in League of Legends or Dota 2 I wouldn't recommend it to you because it has an addicting rank system to see how good you are!-The amount of time you put in to it can be a con I'm just gonna assume some cards are better than others to beat people in this game so you can either grind hours into it and at times lose games because a player's cards are better than yours your actually spend real money in getting gem stuff to buy your way into it!"
"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, the game is kinka enjoyable.. At first.What are the problems?â–º You need to spend half of your life on the game if you wanted to build a deck for your gamestyle. Since the currency for buying a card of your choice is as rare as a white crow.â–º Battlepass. It is a negative by itself.â–º Why can spells damage the masters? How this idea was born?â–º The AI of the minions is horrible. They attack everything but the target you want. Even if you put them just next to the target, they just simply wander off, not caring about the enemy next to them.â–º It is a pleasure to see when you start a draft in a season which ends before you finished your draft. In that case, your old draft build will be total useless against the new draft ones with the super cool new season cards which you defnintely do not have in your old draft deck. At least reset the deck when it happens and let the players put together a deck with actual cards.â–º I don't get how the masters can be called balanced. The 4 armed monster has one passive only and 2 one time use summon which can be defeated without any problem. I beleive it can be used for rushes but they are one time use still.â–º The scrat master's targeted gattling gun shooting skill usually get stuck and don't even shoot a single bullet at the target.â–º Acquiring more of the same card makes no sense if you don't pay for this application. And rolling the random card-automat most likely will give you a copy of one of your cards. At least let us destroy the copies for those blue currency, like in any other normal card games.â–º The randomness in this game is legendary. You can win or lose a game less than 30 seconds. Like.. Seriously..? Award winning for the biggest joke of the year.â–º Spending money on the game is definitely not just cosmetic stuff. Which is unacceptable for a free to play game."
"Early Access ReviewMeh, all the time the same things are being played. Too repetetive because the meta is the same all of the time. A lot of copy pasta decks from the top of the ladder (uses one himself)"
"Early Access ReviewTotally recommend it, it is fun and engaging, Easy to learn and challenging with strategy involved.It is not P2W, it all comes down to strategy on your own.1v1 and 2v2 modes, invite your friends!It was free first in the Discord store, been playing it for a while now."
"Early Access Reviewsimply pay to win.1. pay for the right cards (or grind for weeks/months)2. crush your opponent from the very first wave with the right legendary card, he can't ever catch up3. win in 90 seconds (if you're slow)just don't. you'll end up paying a lot to keep up with incredibly overpowered legendary/supreme decks.. for nothingit's a more cancerous version of hearthstone / artifact / etc because here the imbalance is so extreme that you literally destroy your opponents from the first second if you pay enough and even winning feels horrible (to me) because once you have a deck with immense burst at the start, you just do the same thing for 60-90 seconds each game over and over"
"Early Access ReviewOnly 50 mins in and I like it. For a pay to win game it's pretty good. It is very similar to clash royale, except it has a very different artstyle and some very different strategies involved. So far I would definitely recommend it as something to play for a few hours every so often."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewDefinitely worth checking out once it goes (and stays!) F2P  - in it's current form, the game is in no way pay to win, the microtransactions etc are largely cosmetic; you *can* potentially go ahead and buy cards randomly but with even the slighest degree of competence at the game, you won't need to as the starter deck is pretty OK."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFun and cheap game. Like the other forced games as well. This is just like a mobile game for those gamers that dont wanna play on their damn phones like me :D PC all the way.
"Early Access ReviewClash Royal but with much more cards. I feel like in CR theses days its the same few cards that are played over and over, the meta is so narrow that it makes for repetitive gameplay. There seems to be many more possible playstyles in this game."
Early Access ReviewLOVE this game. Totally worth the price and consistently updated. Extremely addictive formula that is perfect for not only casual players but also those playing in higher levels.
Early Access ReviewBought it for me and my 5 year old nephew and ended up only playing with his dad for 45 hours(not back to back) and we slaughtered most people just trying to have fun.Pros-You COULD play it with younger family members-Cons-loot crates(you can earn new units from in game but it's pushing a pay to win system)
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewPretty fun game, but it gets to feel extremely repetetive very quickly. The battles are fun, and you can pretty much just play for ten minutes and set it back down again if you don't have a ton of time during the day, which is great. The announcer is extremely annoying, and it seems like the dialogue might be a bad translation sometimes, but it doesn't get in the way of the fun.I got it for free (not sure how... it just ended up in my steam inbox), but I would recommend this game if you can get it under $10."
Early Access ReviewGreat game with regular updates - easy to learn and hard to master! Looking forward to it being totally F2P for more players - just wish they included cross-platform support.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewVery fun, I generally find a match in five seconds and quick matchmaking is like omniimportant in something like this. A good fun game for a few rounds on lunchbreak for me"
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game reminds me of clash royale and when I did play it before I was totally engrossed into this game.Playing this game has now done the same thing since it has a similar concept but its really cool with the kind of cards you can get and especially with the different heroes you have. This games so far from playing it is very fun. As well with the ranked system it seems pretty good.
"Access ReviewBasically a clone of a mobile game we all known and can name.With a wee twist to it.Going F2P will have helped the number of players to play against, but all the Pay2Win mechanics that came along with it don't help."

"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGreat Concept, Great gameplay only needs to speed up characters a bit and possible special powerups, early access great start and recommended purchase"
Access ReviewGreat fast paced strategy game - reminds me a lot of Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds which I absolutely loved. The Online PVP format and improved deck building and ranking systems only improve on the formula originating in MTG: Battlegrounds. Plus - Free!
"Early Access ReviewAs you've probably seen in the videos above, the game can be summed up as a 3D PC spin-off of Clash Royale. The game is extremely easy to pick up and play. The develepors have described it as easy to play but hard to master, and that is very true. There are a lot of subtle nuances to how each card plays and you can only figure them out by playing more and more.The Mechanics:You have a deck of 10 cards that you can customize outside of a match (just like in other TCGs). When a match starts, your deck is shuffled and the top 4 cards are dealt to you. When you play a card, it goes to the bottom of your deck and is automatically replenished by the top card. Apart from just seeing the 4 cards in your hand, you are also able to see the next card you will draw. Thus, you have some control over crafting the state of your hand and making combos happen more than once in a match.You can get new cards by using power tokens in a roulette-style gambling system. Power tokens must be bought using either gold or rubies. The only other way to get cards is via single card offers that change on a day-to-day basis (usually cost rubies but occasionally some high gold cost offers do come up). For example, 1 random legendary for 16000 gold. So, make sure to save up some gold for those offers once you have a sizeable collection. Along with your deck, you also get to pair a Master with it that represents your life points in the game (always starts with 3000). Each of these masters has 3 perks (abilities) that are either active (card(s) added to your deck) or passive, and are unlocked during the match when you maintain control of the two bridges in the middle of the arena. There are 9 masters as of this review (12-20-2018), and one more might be added by the end of the month. You can acquire masters by spending either blue shards (earned in-game at a steady pace) or red rubies (must pay $$$ to get enough).Lots of game modes and events:In the beginning, you have to get through a short tutorial before you gain full control of the game itself. By level 9 (i think), you unlock most of the game modes: draft, mayhem and expeditions, along with the basic battle and team battle modes. Pairing up with another player is extremely easy; it only requires you to be steam friends with the other player.The devs always have something new going on in terms of events. The events usually have 3 different houses, each of which has 15 keys associated with them. If you collect all 15 keys for a house, you get a legendary card. Keys can be earned by winning prize fights, which is just randomly determined at the start of a match, and by using streamer keys (watch out for those in the global chat!).Pay to Win? I don't think so.I got to Master league without paying anything with quite a few supreme rares and a couple legendary cards. I played so much last month that I got upto level 75 in the battle pass with only two season gold stars. I had earned 1000 rubies just by way of in-game rewards then finally coughed up 5 bucks to get 200 more rubies to purchase the battle pass. I got so many rewards at once (33 season tokens lol), it was beautiful. This is one of the most balanced free-to-play models i've seen in a while. If you like card games like Magic: The Gathering and Tower defense, definitely check this one out."
"Access ReviewPerfect game to play while listening to a podcast;It reminds me of an old Warcraft 3 mod, Castle Fight. The core mechaninc of defending your base is there, but you don't have to worry about base building.I can't say if it's pay-to-win or not, it doesn't feel like it to me, and I did not buy any decks. "
Access ReviewEasy to jump-in and play. I already have others who want to 2v2. The game mechanics are clear and the stratyegies seem endless. I look forward to future development and am already thinking about buying the expansion. Thanks for this great game.
Early Access Reviewi was playing on the intro battles and what happened was complete and udder cancer.in the middle of the game it told me that i have lost connection to the game servers and told me to quit. but i do not quit so  continued to play this game. and after i won the battle all i could do is hit that quit button and thus making me leave the game with out giving me gold and a new werid rip off of clash royal card person thingy
"Early Access ReviewYo, this game...is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!It's really simple, addictive, fun, and most importantly practically no queue times.I've so far had a dozen games or so with the longest queue time being 23 seconds, where most are like less than 5 seconds, the only ""Early Access"" game I actually respect so far."
"Early Access ReviewThe game is simple enough to pick up and fun enough to keep you playing, letting you build your own decks around you masters adds a certain amount of strategy to the game as well. All around I'm enjoying it so far."
Early Access Reviewi only played like a few games but its nice fast and colourfull gameplay. i did this review due to the games request to do so right away when u reach lvl 10.hf gl its nice so far.
"Early Access ReviewWell, i like it . It's like Clash Royale, i hate Clash Royale . This game is good for me, if i hate Clash Royale and i can talk about this game to my friends ! ^_^ (HATERS GONNA HATE XD)"
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGot this game from a key to try... so far hand down no other way to put it the game sucks. Yes it's fun and fast and good but when you have a  swarm unit thats rare and can take out a non rare thats anti swarm game needs fixed its like saying anti tank mines wont destory a tank because there china made ... total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGreat devs, love everything they make. Never got into clash royal but really enjoy MM. Keep up the good work guys and thanks for the key<3!"
Access ReviewLove this game have it for so long and always comeback.Updates regularly and even more often now with the battle passes (should be a little cheaper or reward more of the money back at later stages but its ok)Matchmaking is always fast and the meta is diverse lots of content for this kind of game 10/10 would recomend good job
"Access ReviewSeems enjoyable so far, but I'm only doing the challenges (PvE) to learn the game. Sort of a twist on a deck buildling/collector game with some tower defense built in, you're instead using the different cards (based on mana, and when you play one it's immediately replaced - mana builds up over time) to summon different types of creatures to help with your tower defense. Spells as well for your ""master"" (the being that represents you in the game - each of which has it's own unique bonuses) to cast to help with combat, and even some buildings that can be constructed. Definitely a lot more to unlock yet, but well worth a try!"
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewLoved this game it is an amazing game it does not need good computers to run because I have a really bad toshiba an it work perfectly fine it's like a game I've play although there's a lot of grinding involved i am in a tornoment called the king puff tournament great that they do stuff like that even thought over card games don't do that it is a amazing feature totally get the game best ever ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ¤— if you want the game then you could get a mag that has a 15 pound steam key for minion masters the mag is called PC GAMERS it only costs 5 pounds
"Early Access ReviewThis game is made by an orgy of other games , king's bounty , League Of Legends and Hearthstone ,so this is a good game orgy the game is good so play if you have 20 $ :3"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTL;DR: Can be pay to win but is still favorable to free players.January 6th, 2017 Update 12 - Blast Entry I recieved this game for free from a Friend. From my knowledge it was not a premium upgradeso I am currently playing it as any other person would when it comes out of early access. Stone 2.Currently reading through reviews and seeing a lot of pay to win complaints. I have spent 0$ on the game so far and definetly had a hard time starting out people do have better cards then you and you can spend money to get more cards. Your method however could either be random or through crafting which anyone can do and isn't explained very well at any point and is briefly touched upon.I'm not good at formatting but this is looking pretty ugly so new paragraph. I have reached level 15 in the game and am stone 2. Within this time frame I've bought a new master(Settsu) and gotten enough free cards from the Token system and level up rewards to have a deck that has allowed me a 5 win streak on this very night. The system used for picking cards prioritizes your Masters experience rewards so you'll almost always be able to use your Masters' spells after getting enough xp to do so. This mechanic alone is enough to add strategy in places where in other games you would just be pulling out high level cards and losing in mere turns since these are all helpful and cost almost nothing sometimes even nothing! This game is pretty amazing. They're doing things right I'm not sure about the community aspect, but I haven't had any points where anything has seemed beyond unfair."
"Early Access ReviewFun for a little while, but got boring pretty quick. Imagine hearthstone in 3d and this comes quite close. Worth picking up in a sale, but not at full price.Edit: I did not realise this would be free to play at release. I suggest holding off until it is released!"

"Early Access ReviewThe gameplay of this game is heavily inspired by Clash Royale, but it has very interesting mechanics that keep it original. While a bit monotonous and repetitive, the gameplay is quite enjoyable, especially if taken in short bursts like a mobile game. The PC is probably not the best environment for this kind of games, but can be a good game nevertheless for some types of players.Unfortunately the game has been completely ruined by the 'Expeditions' gimmick. Essentialy a mini""game"" where you have to explore a dull map just to get the resources needed to get new cards for the main game. Arbitrary power multipliers make the dull experience increadibly frustrating, and force you to grind just so you can win in the main game. Expeditions has has nothing to do with the main game, and completely ruin the experience of this otherwise enjoyable game. Not recommended."
"Early Access ReviewIf you like cancerous titles like clash royale,and like to go against OP cards,and go on losing streaks that make you bang your head against a well,go ahead.Play it."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI'm going to be honest, I saw the price, I saw the art style and I heard it being compared to Clash Royale and I just went ""Ugh..""I thought it would be another microtransaction riddled unplayable mess.But no, it's oddly enjoyable, there's no huge incentive for microtransactions and the gameplay is quite solid. The art style grows on you too.For a game of this price, 9/10As a game in general, 7/10Thank christ for the generosity of the Moderators in one of my Discord servers because if they didn't gift me this game I wouldn't have found this little gem "
"Early Access ReviewA fun and cheap game. Not everything is perfect, but nothing is too broken.The decks are very diverse, even though there seems to be a small cardpool. Which of course is a great thing!The worst: Update 60 Visual Rework.They made the board smaller. Minions got bigger? Really annoying. Very obvious. Just a spam cluster, between the top and bottom as there is less strategic placement.The silly downvotes of people just saying vague stuff such as ""bad game, unistall"" just say it because they're terrible at the game, weirdly enough at least everyone below diamond is not so good. But maybe I'm enjoying this game because of the easy wins, hard to say. I'M NOT IN TOP, only a diamond peasant."
"Early Access Reviewi wasnt sure if id like that when i bought it.. After 9-10 hours in the game (in 2 days) i can say this thing is superaddictive i cant stop playing.. fast ranked maches with different masters and strategies and a huge amount of different minion cards! Thats the sht bro , if you like this kind of games just get it.. The only bad thing about the game is that 1/5 maches are canceled before they even start so you wait sometimes a bit.. but i think this can be fixed , the rest game is great"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis is a very strategic great graphics kinda game, its multiplayer, with usually in normal multiplayer matches, has 4 people with 2 people on each side, its a very good game, with cool new characters to run around with and cool cosmetic skins, all you have to do is play and win matches to earn chests which will get you new and better cards to fight with."
"Access ReviewPretty impressed with this overall. Quite polished already, progression feels really good, and I haven't felt the need to buy anything at all yet. And thank God there's no card upgrading like Clash Royale because that woulda made this game insta-bad."
"Early Access ReviewGot the game on sale, which to be honest is probably the only reason I am giving this a thumbs up. Get it on sale or if you like this type of game.I never encountered any bugs and waiting for other players never took longer than 30secs. Wide range of units, most of which I never unlocked, but I think that is because I am a very casual player.It's not bad, but wait for it to be on sale"
"Early Access ReviewNuff Said...But really this started out great. Now its just another P2W spam-fest with very little room for strategy besides rock-paper-scissors. It's sad to watch another great game with so much potential slowly rot and fester with greed...& the community isn't helping.But there is still hope, & I'll probably be back once they come to their senses and at least put a working anti-cheat system in place....Now where is that final silly achievement"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAlright here goes nothing.Before I say anything else, I gotta clarify I got this game in a giveaway (and from what i can tell you did a lot of those to get people into the game).This game? It's pretty fun. Basically, imagine clash royale with better graphics, rotated sideways, and with no p2w levelling system. (also gratuitous amounts of blood because every game needs that)The mechanics are solid, and they work just fine.There's also a ton of different cards which opens up many different playstyles, from heavier decks to spammier decks to building-based decks to staller decks. Plus the hero system adds a bit more variety to the mix, giving opportunities for synergies between your hero's skills and your decks. There's at least that.Now the problem is, obtaining the cards themselves is based on a random sort of lootcrate/roulette system. You buy tokens to spin that with in-game gold, which you get from daily challenges, achievements and (possibly) a single daily resource spin. That system is entirely governed by RNG, and i can ASSURE you, you'll keep getting repeated cards, most of them common, and the rarer cards are a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get.Repeat cards can normally be recycled for a measly amount of mana shards (which can be used instead of the premium currency to unlock heroes and arena skins), but the most common cards (the ones you'll keep getting) can't even be recycled at all. You'll end with piles of those just lying around, with absolutely no use to them. This makes trying to unlock all the cards and heroes an amazing mix between long, drawn-out grinding and RNG. (which is not in your favour most of the time). But of course, you can just BUY the premium currency to make it easier! On a paid game! Or just buy the premium upgrade which is 4x the price of the game ITSELF to lessen the grind!There's also the issue of content; the game is fun for the first bit you play it, but aside from a few slightly different gamemodes, there's really not much else to do besides trying to climb the ranks (something that's also made harder by the progression system in place). You'll probably get bored after not too long, unless you're an avid fan of this type of games.Look, I'm not saying the game is bad (because it's definitely not, it's well made and fun while it lasts) but it's really not worth buying. It should be a F2P game, especially with this monetization method. It's not worth 5 bucks for the amount of time it'll probably last you. Some people may enjoy it, but it's just not for me."
"Early Access ReviewMinion Masters is a paid ""freemium"" game which the gameplay is a blatantly copied from a freemium mobile game and tweaked just a bit.There is no reason to play this game over the popular mobile game, Clash Royale, as that game has infinitely larger community. I hate games like Clash Royale where the game is heavily focused around in-app purchases (pay 2 win/gain advantage), but if you must play this game it's better to play the mobile game. You can play Clash Royale since mobile games have easier access.Don't bother with this."
"Early Access ReviewDon't even bother it's literally already agro shaman the game. You would think that with the tens of generic boring card games for literally every franchise that gets popular they would have some sort of idea how to balance cards and not make a game this is literally already meta in alpha. You bring in anything over 5 mana you've already lost because the control spells are trash and cost 4 mana, the only good one being a random kill spell which doesn't matter because they just flood the board, and can barely kill anything to begin with then you just get flooded with 3/4 drops. The last thing we need in this world is some uncreative microtransaction bs card game."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis should be a free android / ios app... not a £14.99 steam game!My cousin gifted me the game because he got one, although it's asking me to buy premium in game for £14.99? Forget that...The game is a glamourised, rather boring card battling game.It's very obvious from the start that it's a pay to win game... no skill involved what-so-ever.It's going to be whomever's got the best deck of cards is going to win... hands down.Of course, that's going to be factored by who spends more money on the game...Sorry just not a fan of these ""money grab"" games.I'll stick to games I can just buy and play fairly, where skill is the prime factor in winning...Not games like this where the size of my wallet and stupidity to waste it factors whether or not I'm better than my opponent.Had I paid any money for this game, I would be using steams 2 hour refund policy."

Utilizes (meh, again) CCG system for loadout and collection management: ""deck"", ""hand"", same ""Hearthstone"" rarities, boosters etc.Considered P2W by majority of players, for top-rarity units can only be countered by other top-rarity units, which is very frustrating for beginner players since getting those cards require either grind or money. Plus don't forget to buy Heroes if you want to compete.Your nexus is a stationary Hero, with its own auto-attack and 3 abilities, gained at lvl-ups, normally passive or triggered. XP is gained by controlling a bridge (your unit was the last one present on a bridge - means you control it). Other than that typical rail strategy tactics - this unit type counters that, that counters those, those counter nothing but consume time, etc. Everything is fine until you meet some legendary bs which counters everything except big wallet.There are 3 types of cards: Unit, Building(timed), Spell. Some building can auto-produce units too. Your loadout consists of Hero and 10 cards without duplicates. In match, cards are indefinitely rotating in your 4-card-hand as you play them, plus you can see which card comes next. As of right now, (before release), there is total of ~70 cards and 7 heroes.Map is a small oval halved by impassable line with 2 bridges - basically, its so small that tactics turn into a mess very fast. You can spawn units on your half of the map and some units are so fast that they can reach enemy nexus in just few seconds from there. Thus, matches are lightning fast. And even if tug-o-war prolongs, developers push it to the end manually - resource generation rate constantly increases. So after just couple minutes game already turns into ""smash all buttons really really fast"".Biggest R&D failure I found - alot of things allow you to spawn units on enemy territory (read: right on his face) which allows them to instantly hit nexus without giving a fk about anything else. This doesn't make game any more fun not even mentioning it ruins fundamental principles of rail RTS.Btw game is strictly multiplayer: there are like 10 AI ""Challenges"" but that is just your tutorial - extremely easy and done in no time (read above: lightning fast matches), after that - PVP duels only.Last but not least, game lacks a general style and fixed setting, as for me. Overall it looks like fantasy.. then there are space marines, drones and spaceships.. and then ALL OF A SUDDEN flying kawai rabbit head with huge anime eyes and cute ears. Like, wtf? It's technically Conflux but it feels like Clownery instead, for some reason.Few cosmetics are here too if you wish. Particularly, you can decorate your half of the map with arena skin, they look gut and cost gut.Kind of fun game for 1 evening, but I don't recommend spending any money unless you are fan of rail strategies and be like ""yeah, this is totally my game"".Class: III - BreadVerdict: No But YesReviewed: 12.17.2016Approach: Steam Beta - PCTime: An HourDeeds: 13 Level Wood 3 Rank All AI Challenges Complete 1 Legendary Card "

Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game gets repetitively boring because people are using the same obviously-strong meta decks. If you are one of those people that can get competitive but can't handle the stress and struggle then please avoid this game as much as you can. If you are not being wrecked by rammers and cleavers on rage then you are getting wrecked by a last-minute spell just to shove salt into your open wound.
"Early Access ReviewOh boy..First off starting price was 20 Bucks. RidicioulusNow it is 5 which is still WAY TOO MUCH for its business model.THIS IS A FREE TO PLAY GAME FOR 5 BUCKS - DONT BE FOOLED!There is premium currency in this game, lootbox style card gathering (yes, it is a wheel, but that doesnt change the system) MP is either: You wrecking,  You getting totally wrecked , or (which is very bloody likely) you or your enemy just loose connection and therefore the match ends without a single card played.

"Early Access ReviewWhat an absolutely total waste of money and time. This game is not beta, this is even not alpha stage. This is stage where you try to hire somebody non-idiot to do network part of the game and can't succeed yet. Minions take 10 seconds to spawn due to huge ping."
"Early Access ReviewTLDRCasual Player ✓Competitive Player XThe game is starting to try to appeal to more casual players and the devs have always been lackluster in playing the game and their gameplay resulting in half the cards being underpowered/overpowered and like 20% niche cards with a use but keep getting buffed just because they aren't shining in every scenario when they have metas they shine in and certain scenarios. There isn't really any reason to play besides ""fun"" and to see new content. The devs are casual players themselves majority of them none of them being spectacular in gameplay or anything and that's exactly why this game will be boring in the long run if you're starting as a new player. They do not understand and also do not seem to care to add an incentive to keep playing the game. The game will eventually become stale after a bit for most and then that's it. Nothing else to do besides climbing to rank 1 which when you are rank 1 that point is gone and basically all the reason to play the game is gone as well. They are extremely delusional if they think adding glory was the way to keep players playing and the community is basically a mess. An example of devs not caring is someone who plays enough and has high enough win % to be like at least 8k points above most GMs and yet the devs do not care in the slightest to add a points display to make it easier to see who is where and to display points which would be helpful in knowing how far people are above/below you. As well as just displaying the huge difference in points rather than a slight number change. They also seem to think it's fine to make GM to be so easily reachable that you can get to GM with a negative win ratio and even though a solution has been talked about for the 250+ GMs this season they just want to slightly make it harder which is not even comparable to 8k points on top of GM and yet no new rank or rewards or any incentive of that sort but a slight number change in leaderboard rank. They also make poor choices like deciding to nerf a card based on a meta that I spread in 2 days due to > them taking a vacation. < Like really? Their own mistake for timing it poorly when they take a vacation and then listen to a bunch of casual players on balance.. The funny part is they hit it with a double nerf to ensure the card goes from popular to unusable by most. There's a lot of things wrong with the game but if you do happen to play and enjoy it then not really a reason to stop playing if you enjoy it. If you don't enjoy actively playing then you probably should quit unless you're a casual player due to the devs being alien to anything but casual players nowadays so it seems. The community is a whole other story. The vast amount of people that are core in the community are either very ironic or very delusional. They also seem to make random poor decisions that no one really asked for but casual players such as the UI rework which the theme still looks very ugly to me. And recently some change with the pings which messed up alt tabbing which is now reverted but apparently with the way they worded it did not seem like a bug to me. They even changed a mechanic of Morgrul one time because casual players got too confused about an interaction somehow lol. A card named Demon Warrior also got reworked due to community outcry even though the card was weak in 1vs1 vs any deck with aggro after the arena change and was only OP in 2vs2 if supported correctly and played correctly by two decent players. You're probably thinking sure they reworked a card that was oppressive if played correctly and in the right scenarios but the issue is what came after. They reworked the card and made it so horrid it basically doesn't exist in the game anymore since it's so weak tier wise. Most of the tournaments are also a joke from extremely ironic to sabotaging staff to poor performing and generally not that great ""tournament players"" constantly boasting about how good they are and how flawless their gameplay is for playing in a tournament with no wildcards rule and that's it. Their play isn't that spectacular and some of them definitely do make a lot of mistakes but would in the past try to make you believe tournaments were special or something to look forward to when they really aren't. There were some and still are some pretty decent tournament players but there are also lackluster ones so would suggest you not fall for the tournament hype other than it being different due to no wildcards rule in a specific tournament. There are some ""veteran"" players that play 1 hour a week and the devs are more willing to listen to input from players like that than players who are actively playing their game that are grinding ladder to get an extremely vast amount of points that are almost worlds apart from GM rank 3 and below currently. It is grind but you also require a pretty high win ratio and decently timed games to be effective if for example the rank 2 GM is trying just as hard to get rank 1. It gets to the point of 40 points per win and 120 points per loss even vs 98% of GMs due to the vast points difference which is fine. The issue is there is basically no incentive to get rank 1 besides a number change on the leaderboard and how they can't even code it properly for past leaderboards to show up beyond 12 months. The one thing they done well recently was just adding new cards in general with each season of a battle pass. There was a time when the game lacked updates on PC completely many months ago which is now changed. The game is not really P2W but do remember it's a card game so when you start out you're going to have to collect cards to use most combinations but you can definitely get by vs top players with a less unique deck if you're good enough. You simply just spin tokens with ingame currency to get cards and if you play a bit you'll basically have most cards but legendary cards and most legendary cards are either niche or unviable but some of them being pretty decent like Xiao. You'll mostly only be lacking in combinations like Xiao x2 x3 as a new player which is usually for 2vs2 decks and not always ran but you can run it and is strong in certain decks. Setting aside the community, devs, dev decisions and so on the game itself isn't that bad for what it is. You can definitely have fun with this game if it fits your style of game. Although I would say the moment you stop having ""fun"" then it's probably time to quit or come back in like 6 months and then quit again."

Early Access ReviewBetadwarf seems to have mastered the art of repackaging their assets over and over into a different and enjoyable experience every time.  Minion Masters is all the same characters you know and love now getting other people to do most the fighting.  It's my favorite so far.
Early Access ReviewBots bots bots! When you try to play against other people all you get is bots! And they are extremely easy. So if all you care about is advancing by playing AI set to easy mode then go ahead I guess. As of now the match queue is FULL of bots.
"Early Access ReviewJust... wrong.  I feel bad for fans of Forced and Forced: Showdown that sprung for the premium edition.   This is basically Forced's answer to a CCG with plenty of microtransactions.  It's a cynical cash grab on what (was) a fun action franchise.I suppose it's a very unique take on the CCG genre where your cards come to life and fight each other, but since better cards require either a large amount of grinding or buying ingame ""rubies"" with real money.  There are too many games like this now to compete for my time and cash, and it's getting exhausting."

Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewCute game but seems like balance would be all over the place and has a high chance of having P2W or grind for a eternity system which I'm sick of.If you've ever played Castle fight in WC3 then it's that but with unit types needing to be either bought or grinded for who knows how long.
"Early Access ReviewImagine if Clash Royale had a base cost, and it still cost just as much for micro transactions. They just keep adding more micro transactions as well as a battle pass system. The game used to be decent."
"Early Access ReviewWhile it has a strategy, I feel like it's buried beneath the mediocrity and certain card mechanics in the game (e.g. multisummon cards and flying cards.)Even upon entering my first online pvp match, the power of those mechanics was evident.Upon entering the battlefield, I decided to use a multisummon card to attack while I got more mana.He quickly responded by playing a flying multisummon card that instantly wrecked my minions.I tried to summon some ranged minions to deal with them.He summons two more multisummon cards.I try to use the fireball spell (which doesn't work because all of his minions are flying).He summons more multisummon flying cards.I summoned more ranged to deal with him.He casts a lightning spell to hurt me and kill my ranged minions.And that last bit repeated for the next five minutes until he killed me. My first match. Nothing I could do but watch as the ""rarer cards you get later on or now by spending"" gave me no hope of fighting back.The game seems like it could be fun..... if you banned half the cards in the entire game. At that point, is the game even worth playing as opposed to other mobile style games?On a side note, this game was released in December 2016, and still in early access? I understand some developers dream big, but there isn't even really much in the game right now, combine that with the ""buy one get one free"" sale happening,and some reviews saying they were gifted this game by an unknown source (possibly devs)... It just seems a little suspicious. Not trying to hate on the devs if they really want this game to succeed, but it just seems like you're beginning to get really desperate for a playerbase here."

"Early Access ReviewPay to win. I got the game for free and I feel bad for the people who actually paid money to get a pay to win game.Also if you lose connection to a game for a second, you instantly lose and get kicked out."
"Early Access ReviewA very nice take on Clash royale.Cards do not get stronger by levelling, so you can put together a competitive deck very fast, as long as you acquire the meta cards. Most of them are cheap due to being commons or uncommons.I didn't put much time on it, nor any money, and already made it to top 100 just from Clash Royale experience, a feat that i couldn't achieve into that mobile game because i lack the card levels to do so.Overall, feels like a more casual and fair approach to clash royale genre."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGot the game for free, still wasn't worth it.Gameplay: Generic mobile lane CCG. There are a few hundred variations of this on Android/iPhone. Is this one any better? No. In fact, in many ways it's worse.Community: Like any f2p game, the community is primarily made up of people who speak no English, lag terribly and will use cheap tactics to win whenever possible.Sound: Average. Not terrible. Graphics: The graphics are decent for what they are, but nothing special.Story: There isn't one.Overall: If you like these sorts of games, there are plenty of options for you out there, especially on mobile."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewReally addictive game, It's a tower defense kind of game where you unleash units fighting over 2 bridges which when controlled give you bonus XP for in match perks. It's a balanced strategy card game kind of where flying counters melee and ranged counters flying etc.  I think it should be free to play like other games similar to this but dropping some money on it is worth it as all the cards can be easily obtained it's not too grind heavy."
"Early Access ReviewAt first I really enjoyed the game and found myself winningg and having fun. I kept going up in rank ant then it happened - cheaters. The output of the people once you hit the silver league is often clearly illegitiment. I am fine with losing as long at it was a fair fight, and still fought may rounds at the silver level where the player was clearly not cheating but just good - those were tough but fair matches I lost. However, once you get to that point you will start finding players who are clearly able to output more cards than they could possibly have mana. That's when it lost me. Fix the cheating problem and I will return... Not recommended - shame too it was fun until I realized I won't get beyond a certain league without cheating."
"Early Access ReviewGame shows promise. I will be playing this more and will provide a full review lator.At the momment take my spite to say, this game is good, but it can be better.If you've played clash royal on mobile, this is exactly that except you have no princess towers, and your 'king' can be customized with diffrent pre-set charicters with diffrent abilitys + bonuses for holding the bridges."
"Early Access ReviewJust when I start to enjoy the game, it randomly crash... Sometimes is in the first game, sometimes I can play a lot of matches without problem. But what makes me rage the most, is that almost every time it crash, is when Im about to win...."
"Early Access ReviewPay to win game, don't even try it, everytime they release a new set of cards the kids just throw a bunch of money to get them and obviously those cards are OP as hell, and then there are the fan boys saying ""hurr durr you can play to get the cards, they are available for free"" but then again you can pay to get them faster and easier and wipe some a$$es as soon as you throw money at them. I cannot recommend this ""P2W"" game unless you want to:1.- spend money or a lot of time to get quality cards...2.- get wiped by paying players or players w/no life...3.- get ready to copy top ten decks in order to remain competitive, because real strategy is non existent thanks to the fact developers decided to put the top ten leaderboard cards visible for anyone, so you just need to throw money at it, copy top ten decks, and climb your way to the top..."
"Early Access ReviewDevelopers decided that £15 is not enough that I paid, now I have to watch countless hours of twitch streams in order to get keys to unlock a hero and this is the only way??? really??? rrreeeeaaaally??? ♥♥♥♥ off!"
"Early Access ReviewEarly access and pay to win? Utter garbage.I got this in a Humble Monthly deal and got premium access to the game. I started with enough of the THREE in game currencies to give myself a major boost. Normal people have to rely on luck to get the best cards, but if you pay a little money you can pick them from the get go. Sure there is a tiny amount of skill, but paying more will guarantee you more wins."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI have really struggled with this game. Being free and decent graphics, I have given it more than one chance. The game simply never takes off and never gets genuinly fun to play."
Early Access ReviewMinion Masters is a game that I recommend because:- it is a method to banish boredom- it has an acceptable price- it has strategy- it has multiplayer mode- is is indie- it has trading cardsEnjoy!
"Early Access ReviewI got this game for free and had never heard of it before, now I cannot stop playing it.I normally don't like competative ""card"" games, but this is a ton of fun. I would have happily paid for it."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe duo rank coop part of the game is so fun !!Clash Royal without the mobile time waiting. No limited chest slot. No waiting time for opening chest.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewMinion Masters is a strategy game mixed with a bit of action of course. The game controls a lot like duelyst, however you can choose where your units go. It reminds me a lot of clash royale. It's a very fun game and I'd recommend it."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewNot a bad game if your new it is best to play in the afternoons. The is the price problem here I got my for free but paying for a game with a pay to win system installed bothers a little.  A buy at $2 or less and more if you like this type of game go for it.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSo I left this game sitting around in my library (not an unusually occurrence for me) for a long, long time. Then, one day, I randomly decided to give it a go while I had a few minutes to spare. I was not disappointed. Minion Masters presents a new take on the card game/minion spawn genre while offering a deceptively easy-to-learn concept and a smooth interface. The humor in the game is very digestible to nearly everyone, and adds a certain charm to the game. The 2v2 combat works well, and can be played either with a friend or with a random. In-game purchases are available, but you also earn the in-game currency as you play. Minion Masters seems to be very well balanced, and the minions are programmed well enough that they really do seem to simulate a real combat situation. There's lots of good cards, so early on deck building is easy. Be wary, though - as you get into higher ranks, you definitely need to strategize and take note of what cards work and what cards don't!"
"Early Access ReviewIt was good but it stopped to be good. First say made anoying boring events. There you got a random redeem code and for a random numbers of wins. But for the real price you needed about 40 codes. So you just had to check forum for codes that expired after different numbers of hours (some 1 some 24 ande a few unlimited). But xou often got codes that you allrdy got. So it was realy anoying.Now it got worser. They made boring map events. To move you need 1,5 wins for 1 field. On that map are bosses that drop a skin by random. The maps are realy big and you need 5 or more hours winning games to clear 1 map. The chance to win the skin is realy small so its just frustrating. The fights on the maps against npcs is only anyoing.Another point is that you can play team fights. With premade teams and random teams. The crap is when you with random teammates you can hit a premade team that build together their decks and use teamspeak and you only have a random member.If you don´t want to play the whole day minion masters to get forward dont start the game."
"Early Access ReviewFun Game but they put SO MUCH GRIND in it, statring to look like another cash grab. Grind for hours for a cpl cards or pay real cash. Im on the fence really, if they fixed the ammount of grind and let ppl actually earn stuff without wanting to claw your eyes out from grind i would be a personal fav. *looks for neutral review button*"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAt first it seems all fun and bit but it gets quite frustrating pretty quick.This game revolves around setting up combos, countering the enemy combos mixed with a bit of luck. However some counters can be so strong that you might as well sit afk and see how you get destroyed. There is no coming back from them no matter how good you are. Also, if you're lucky at the start (good starting cards, play) you can pretty much snowball the game and your opponent will never recover. This game has some serious balance issues and I wouldn't recommend this game in this state. This is Alpha however, so things might get smoothed out (though no such changes have been made while I played the game). For now keep away from this game and save yourself some money on it and it's P2W microtransactions (I was glad I did not pay for the game)."
"Early Access ReviewConsider a different opinion.  You only need one finger to play this game.  Point and click - boring even if it was only on a phone.  Pros:  1.  It does work very well.  2.  It looks great.  3.  There is strategy involved, and it seems well balanced.  Cons:  1.  It feels as if you have no legs and only one finger."
"Early Access ReviewSeems good on the first few days, but gets boring fast. The communty getting toxic if you play in a random team. You need to invest in good cards to have a chance, so its basicly P2W♥♥♥♥♥♥again. PLS God strike those moneyhoes with a lightning"
"Early Access ReviewDont bother buying or playing it, the devs dont care about the game anymore, matchmaking is a joke, bugs take week to fix, mainly the small ones.The game was fun but with every ""update"" you can tell the devs are just trying to keep people on it enough to use the microtansactions ingame to get a bit more money out of it.True shame as this game was really good and had great potential100 hours late and ive finally uninstalled the game till i hear news that the developer starts to address issues in the game and become even half active."
"Early Access Reviewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tt8Fq8n69IMy opinion of this game is a neutral one. Minion Masters is a mix of Hearthstone and Clash Royale. It is a multiplayer game where you select a hero and then create a deck of 10 cards. You battle other players to move up in ranks and get rewards. Minion Masters looks great, runs great, and is a ton of fun to play. However, it is really lacking in content, the player base is tiny, and the game is a massive grind. The $20 entry fee is a joke as it is obvious this game will go free to play once it is done and the premium upgrade is a farce aside from the in-game currency that it provides.2x gold for 1 year is pathetic. You earn 20-30 gold per win and 10 per loss. With this upgrade you get 50-60 gold or 20. Meanwhile, a token (this game's equivalent of a card pack) costs 1,000 gold and you get either a card or shards (this game's equivalent of Dust). The permanent EXP upgrade is decent until you hit level 20, then it becomes a slog to level up.Speaking of tokens, check this out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtYPIAyYeSoYea........ I don't know."
"Early Access ReviewGreat game, but I get disconnected from the servers right before victory screen, which not only negates my win, but kicks me out of game as well. Happened to 60% of all my matches in the last 12 hours, its unbearable to play and have half of your progress negated. Also had a thing happen where my teammate (not premade) was disconnected during the start of 2v2 battle, which not only ended the game, but gave me a deafeat as well.Until this is fixed, do not consider playing the game, it just invalidates all your progress and the time you spent on it. Also the in-game economy is kinda dumb, because all the units are in this rock-paper-scissors  relation where A counters B, B counters C, and C counters A, and thus top players are all relying on a strategy which consists of abusing a few very strong cards, that you can't get unless you spend a lot of hours on the game on average, thus making the game pay to win for many new players. And since every drop you get is RNG based, unless you are exceptionally lucky, you are looking at 50-60 hours of game-time to build one strong deck.But, the game is still young, and it is very fun to play, so these are mostly just concerns about its state. The main reason I'm not recommending is because of the constant win-negating connection issue which has completely ruined the game experience for me."
"Early Access ReviewI was winning a match on draft, suddenly the game went crazy and it said ""I"" ended the match, as a result losing it.It's really hard to win a match and when I finally do this stupid game says I left and lost. Alright then.My current rate:█▀▀█ 　 █ 　 ▄█░ █▀▀█ ░░▀▄ 　 █ 　 ░█░ █▄▀█ █▄▄█ 　 █ 　 ▄█▄ █▄▄█ Bots should be added for possible training. If this happens I'll change my view on this game since it will be a place where we can (hopefully) choose the bots difficulty, win, and actually feel good. :vAt first every match was pretty easy to win and I actually decided to call this a relaxing game, later it got more competitive and impossible..."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI'm feeling a bit sorry for the people, who payed for this ""THING"". Why I don't like this and why I give a negative rating? The awnser is simple and the people, who were used to be hooked to it's mobile alternative will understand me. I have had really bad experiences in the mobile lookalike(maybe the original version and idea of this kind of games), on mobile it was really pay-to-win. The same as here it is. You may say: The skills matter not the tools, but in this games it ain't so. From where do I know this. A friend of mine has payed something like 25 EUROS for the mobile alternative and well believe me or not, he reached the higher areas for some days.I got this one for free and well I personally didn't enjoyed it. I think this type of games are pointless, because it is not always about the player and his strategies, it's about who is the bigger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and who will ♥♥♥♥ his oponent first. Just a timewaster that is not worth buying.(Why don't you go play the mobile alternative for free and get the same experience??)"
"Early Access ReviewI win pretty much every round I play and my opponents act very dumb all the time. So I suspect that I'm playing against the bots. I don't like it. I was expecting to challenge other people, not the computer that makes stupid decisions and left no satisfaction of victory.  The game is really good looking and have a potential, though"
Early Access ReviewFun tug of war style game. with unit counters and spells just like any good rts. if you have ever enjoyed nexus wars or desert strike from the starcraft 2 arcade you can probly get some enjoyment out of this.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewPros -Lots of different minions, masters etcA pretty decent progress system even though it will take you ages to level up once you're at lv 20+Graphics are nothing to complain about, animations are good, voice acting is OK as wellFor early acces very little to no bugs/glitches-Every move you make will have consequences, you can't just spam minions and hope to win because you won'tFor example, if you're gonna use ground minions to fight flying minions you're not gonna get anywhere. Some minions are resistant to arrows so you'll have to use melee-based minions etc.. this game requires skill, to become a ""master"" of this game isn't going to take you forever, but it's not like anyone can pick up this game and be good at it the instant they play it.Cons-Kind of pay to win, even though you can get everything for free, it will take you forever. Luckily the in-game ""premium"" currency is quite cheap so most things should be affordable. And pay or play a lot you will have to, as you will never get anywhere above bronze if you don't have a well equipped deck with supremes, legendaries etcFeels somewhat repetitive after a while, might be just me.Can't really think of anything else!So in conclusion, i would definetly recommend this game. I don't think it's one of those games you'll spend thousands of hours on but it's alot of fun to play"
"Early Access ReviewCheck out our Steam Curator Page and Website[bluntlyhonest.review] for even reviews and exclusive content!A child's game?While Minion Masters looks very colorful it is not so much a childs game but a game for all ages, I would not say for very young as some of the minions can be a little frightening for very sensitive children, combat is blood free and devoid of all except cartoon violence, when playing against AI there are varying degrees of difficulty, however the game truly shines when facing other players, no two matches are the same, and you may find your previously winning deck wont be enough.The game while having a system of micro transactions is incredibly fair to those who don't wish to pay and a massive array of cards can be unlocked simply by playing the game.Blue Streak speeds by....Both matchmaking and match times are very fast, i never had to wait more than 1 minute to jump into a match and often it was around 10 seconds, the matches themselves at lower levels last around 1-2 minutes which gives you a chance to play for either short or long periods of time.Simple to pick up, difficult to Master.The starting aI and honestly the lowest tier players are not much challenge, so new players of all skill levels will find it not too difficult to develop their basic skills, while higher leveled AI and higher ranked players are cunning and you will need to keep on your toes and perform at your bets if you want to take home the win!Cheaper than Cheap Chips.The game is as cheap as chips and often goes free on various third party websites right now Discords store is giving away free copies even, so its a great time to jump right in and start playing minion masters.https://bluntlyhonest.review/2018/10/02/minion-masters-good-cheap-fun/ "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewPeople calling this a cash grab likely are the same ones who called Hearthstone a cash grab of Magic and they need to actually play the game first.I find the game very enjoyable and while the art style makes it a little more difficult to see what's going on in the game compared to Clash Royal, I think the other things it brings to the table make up for that.I like the idea that I have a character rather than just units.I like that minions do not level up as I found that process annoying in Clash royal.I like the bridge holding and hero leveling system present in the game as it adds a little more depth to the game.and I like that this is on PC since I would rather play it here then on my phone.I understand that last point may be a negative to some people but it is a plus to me.I admit the only reason I played the game at all was because I got a free key, but I am glad I did. The game is still a little rough around the edges but I feel this could really turn itself into a competitor with Clash Royal.That said wait for the game to become free to play and don't buy into early acess unless you are dying for this type of game on pc."
"Early Access ReviewI am lucky enough to get this game off the humble bundle, because I don't have to worry about refunding my purchase. This is a pay to win game. You spend cash in-game to get better cards even at the lowest level. So pay 100 Dollars = Tons of rare, powerful cards you can summon to beat people even at entry level. My first Pvp match was me simply getting swamped with cards/rares/epics I had 0 Answers to.The PVE campaign gives you 4 tokens ish, you can also buy 2500 Gems worth of tokens for purchasing the game. There is no real restrictions to your deck except for the cards you place in it. So early game you can just wait till you have enough to summon 2 beef cards with great damage/hp and steamroll your opponent in dirt league. Sounds like a phone game put on steam, just about the same low tier quality too. Save yourself frustration unless you have 200 Bucks to burn to ""Be a pro"" at this game."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis is carbon copy of clash royale with 1 added feature. Your main castle is a hero and that hero levels up as you kill the enemy or have your own summons walk over the bridge.Clash royale is F2P with grinding for lootThis is Pay once to play with grinding for loot. 
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGot this game for subscribing to their e-mail.I've had fun with the game, kinda sad there is no real single-player but I guess that's hard to do in this kind of TCG/Arena kind of game. You unlock cards at a decent rate, there are so far 6 heroes that play differently(ish) from each other, and you can make really different decks as well!I would NEVER in my life pay for this though. And since the last update they added a new currency, wich is premium. My thanks for playing during the closed alpha was 300 of this new currency (Unlocking an arena, a cosmetic, costs 1400.)Good game if you can get it for free, or maybe 3 bucks."
Early Access ReviewOriginally gave this a good review but on deeper analysis I realised how Pay 2 Win this game is.Good luck getting better cards and winning without spending money on ingame currency.
"Early Access ReviewAbsolute garbage of a game, and not because of its rng-base, but because of it internal balance - you get an opponent with a legendary card? Well boyo you are ♥♥♥♥ed big time, as this game is actually based on how good creatures you have in your deck. Skill is not really involved.Also they included a 3rd party software into EULA. Enjoy being used for mining."
Early Access Reviewreverse update 60 lets play on phones update. I dont own a PC for mobile games and i hate that i bought this only to have it completely reworked into a mobile game. Where is my refund?
"Early Access ReviewMinion Masters is a game that kind of let me down, I recieved the game when it was in beta for a sale price of $20 US and if I had actually purchased it at that price I would have been severely let down because it is essentially a rehashed Clash Royale with an upgradeable King Tower. So it is a definite no from me."

Caution should immediately stop what is going on here otherwise would be forced to stop this game I deal with games plus 20 years And that I have not seen to be done in any game  
"Early Access ReviewPay to win garbage that wants to be like hearthstone, worst game I've ever gotten in a humble bundle by far. Its a real shame that the people behind Forced wasted all their potential on a ""fee to pay"" game.Better cards if you pay, you can craft the cards you want when you pay. This will become more obvious when the premium that everyone paid 20 bucks for wears off and more content is released. I was even getting extra bonuses to my ranking, not sure if thats due to premium or not though, and I'm not reinstalling to check.Gameplay would be fun when it gets polished, but the last thing gaming needs is more freemium card games that reward spending cash with advantages. They should have just eliminated the cards and RNG completely and kept the core gameplay with some other gimmick like skins to lure in spenders."

"Early Access ReviewFee to pay, you pay for the game then you pay more.Its not pay to win, its pay not to suck. You cant buy anything you cant earn, but you start at such a level of sucktitude, you need to pay to get out of the suck.This isnt really very fun to get smashed by people that are paying to get ahead of you. This being said, the single player part of this is actually really fun. But its incredibly short, a few hours at most.I would give it a nuetral if i could, but at this point, the monetization model is not good.Addendum 90 minutes in and done with the single player...yeah not worth it unless you want to put more money towards the game in addition to the base price.For full disclosure, I got this as part of humble monthly."

"Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty entertaining for the first 15 levels or so. You can complete all the PvE challenges and reach the Silver PvP rankings relatively quickly. However, once you reach the Silver level, you will go back and forth between Silver and Bronze for quite awhile. The reasons for this are systemic. The cards you recieve as a reward are random and the difference in power level, mana cost, and usefulness vary wildly between rarity levels (common, regular, rare, legendary, and supreme). For this reason, those who subscribe to the pay to win game style (at the cost of other players' fun) or those who have been playing the game enough to accumulate a quality card collection quickly begin to dominate the game, countered only by bad luck in their randomized draws during individual matches. This turns the game into yet another one of those skinner box games that eschews interesting gameplay as it's primary mechanism for engaging and retaining its player base.Tl;drThis is skinner box game that is fun for a day, so long as you bought it on sale, but beware of getting sucked into grinding just to be competitive."
"Early Access ReviewGood: Graphics, Sound Effects, Polish, Multiple modes of play, Not pay to win as legendary cards are not more powerful than commonsBad: Limited number of cards, heroes don't feel exciting enoughHorrible: Almost ZERO players playing. It's multiplayer only (for the most part) so it's going to shut down sooner rather than later"
Early Access ReviewAnyone want this game? They keep giving me free copies. The game is just an in game money scam. Pay to maybe win. but probably not.TLDR: Game suck give freeGave them all away hopefully...
"Early Access ReviewI've tried this game out and honestly only played the introduction.I was so overwhelmed about the lack of challenge during the first 3 introduction missions, that I started looking up towards the fourth mission, playing against another player.During this battle, I didn't even try to win, yet I won easily...I didn't feel accomplished, so I pressed ALT + F4."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis is a game meant for mobile devices.This game isn't balanced.This game doesn't look good.This game isn't fun.Don't pay the current $20 for this piece of crap that averages 200 players.Don't even play it when it goes free-to-play.Stay away from the game.
"Early Access ReviewGeneric mobile game on PC. Predatory monitization , generic graphics, incredibly annoying announcer. A collection of everything wrong with games trying to jump onto the fortnite/hearthstone bandwagon."
"Early Access ReviewPlaytime: 2 hoursHello,time for another review...Sadly no recommendation!At first I thought this game was actually pretty cool and although I hateClash Royale (popular Mobile Game that is similar to this game) I stillliked it. But after a few hours of gameplay I have to say I am very disappointed.As you now the game is called Minion Masters, I'd rather call it Minion Spammers.Really. If you spam a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of small minions that cost less you automatically win.Thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because it takes abouit 4 out of the 10 cards from your dech to spamtha absolute crap out of someone but it takes 10 out of the 10 cards from your deckto counter that. WHY??? There is absolutely no need for that. Because the gameactually has cool cards with cool abilities but that doesn't matter because It isworthless against a minion spam.I have to say I got it for free and I got a key from betadwarf to share with a friend,but I won't let them endure the pure disappointment that Minion Mastersis (right now).I feel really sad that my review has turned out this way but there is no possibilitythat I would recommend this game in it's current state.After three games against a friend that spammed the absolute crap out of me,we both came to the conclusion that it's no fun to play anymore.I still hope you have a great day though because I do not anymore"
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe only reason this came onto my radar is because it was offered for free as part of a promotion. The game itself has potential and kind of like the concept but the fact it's a free to pay title at present is enough to put most off bothering with it.
"Early Access ReviewBrawl of Ages was the only Clash Royale type/ripoff/copycat game on steam and now, Minion Masters is here too, and quite frankly, this is better, funner, quirker (sorry $2) AND at the current moment, has a playerbase. If you enjoy the Clash Royale type of games but got sick and tired of Clash Royale itself like me, but also dont want to play the other ones on the mobile that are arguably better than Clash Royale itself (such as Warzone: Clash of Generals, Titanfall something which might aswell be the best one at the moment and Chaos League, all better than CY itself) then this is the game for you, right now, and always. Has great humor (atleast with the spokeperson) has great design in sound, art, graphics, characters or minions as you call them (albeit i dunno whats the deal with Scrats but that and some other characters like Succubus still leaves some some to be desired, the squeaks though...feels bad listening and how useless the poor little fellas are...) but are mostly quite well made, the graphics are great, i love the physics to everything when they die, even the masters on towers fall down which is realy nice, gore is great and not too exagurated, and the masters themselves have a whole lot of personality, VOICED personality i might add albeit i wish they talked more as they sound quirky (atleast the Lighting guy), than other games of the genre, look great to look at, multiple ones with multiple strategies sure make it interesting to pick one from the bunch avaivable, the new mechanics such as the bridges giving xp for perks is great, musics and soundtracks are great, the game is very, very generous with the free stuff it gives aswell as the devs personaly themselves who keep this updated with new content reguarly often alot, its realy, realy fun and enjoyable to play, you have multiple varying modes to play in (even an upcoming single player map adventuring which is gonna be a first!), leagues, rewards, daily quests, no crappy chests you gotta wait hours on, albeit there is no minion/card upgrading like the other games have (not sure if its needed or not), and balance health wise might need more improvements, but the game's lore is neat, it isnt tied to anything albeit maybe just the future or something? So you get to see all kinds of wacky minions, medieval, fantasy, futuristic, etc. (kinda like Chaos League), and just like other games of its kind, you make multiple decks, synergize, use 3 same cards of one specific card 2 cards of 2 other cards, build up a winning streak to advance faster, made by the guys who made the FORCED games (which saddly i have not played but always known of their existance with their striking name), you can even buy different arenas for your side of the arena, which is better than being tied to the league arenas like in the other games, but one of the best parts comparing to those games, this game has horrible less unit/character/minion copies of other games and has far more completly unique made up minions that dont copy those from other games, it still has some like the Living Statue, Pulse Marines, etc. but not nearly enough for it to feel that way, which is awesome, its a realy great game, realy fun, realy good looking and sounding for the most part and its looking like its only going to get better, my only problem with the game is that i can only reset 1 daily quest per day and get quests involving playing with friends, while i have those, what i dont have is cooperation, willingness to play and i dont mean just me, so it would be nice to maybe get less of those? I dunno, not realy a huge deal breaker, i can get by it. Either way, love the game, keep up the great work ya all, i can wholesomely recommend this.''GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLL.    d.'' - funniest bit."
"Early Access ReviewGood concept, interesting cards and masters for varied play... Balancing is utter garbage. If you don't have the cards that are over tuned that week, you'll lose even with a proper and well rounded deck. To top it off, one of the 3-4 over tuned cards can be bought in a pack for cash in the shop. Team Battles are a JOKE when you're paired as 2 randoms verses premades.Don't bother if you actually are looking for a game with any sense of strategy in deck building."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewWell, I have almost 100 hours ingame and I have more than enough of it.I got maximum wins in draft (which is basicly arena in hearthstone), Best rank possible in ranked plays and although hearthstone and minion namsters are different types of game, they are both the same rng crap. In ranked, you started playing against deck that counter you? Good, you can leave game, no chance of winning or reason play. In draft, do you have better opening hand than your oponent? Good, you win, next game.Most fun is at the lowest leagues, where people are just playing and trying everything and because there is NOT game mode where you can just try other decks you have, you MUST play ranked, so if you reach diamond and you want to try another deck, well, hello silver.You can see leaderboard ingame, which include decks of players there and that mean there are just bunch of idiotes copying decks, which lead to extremly boring game.After you saw 2 times whole animation of opening chest/power token it is just waste of time to watch animation of 5 chests opening and using 40 power tokens, (you can skip part of animation of power token) Since i got annoyed by it i dont buy any power tokens and after you finish draft mode, its much faster to just ALF+F4 game and re-open it than watch all the animations.And not metioning that some masters/cards are extremly overpowered and devs have no interest to fix them.Overall:- gameplay- animations- when you reach higher rank in ladder or more wins in draft, you basicly play against 2 or 3 different people+ you can really quickly get all the cards and masters+ artstyle "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewActually very fun game, in the beginning you're getting lots of cards for achievements and level ups, but sadly after first 10-15 hours grinding becomes unbearable. You only get ONE RANDOM card per ~50games it's 3-5 hours of gameplay, ridiculous.Also this game should be f2p."
"Early Access ReviewReally basic gameplay and lack of variety in the ""masters"" quashed the exciment I had for the concept.  Can't recommend it in it's current state but maybe with future content expansion."
"Early Access Reviewin its current state, its way to unbalanced, some of the creatures are so strong that you cant really do anything against them, take the arcane golem for example, if you dont kill it in the first 10 seconds after its spawned. it basically becomes immortal and one shots every mob you send at it. and there is the dragon nest, the dragons it spawns are more or less invunrable to any anti-air you have access to early on. sure you can fireball the nest, but that depends on if your lucky enough to actually have one ready, if not its basically GG or at least 3/4 of your life gone since no units can kill the dragons. oh and its a massive pay to win fest.TLDR: unbalanced and pay to win, i would stay clear of this game untill they have rebalanced at least the most broken units"
"Early Access ReviewThis game make you pay to play then also has pay to win. Completely insane concept. The community is so adamant that EA is worse, Idon't give a ♥♥♥♥. If this is your business model ♥♥♥♥ off. Then the community insisted that the devs needed our support with the 5 bucks to keep the game going, are you so blind that you can't see the micro transactions will ""support"" them? I got banned from chat for calling a mod ""kid"" I was being toxic but how can you not be mad at developers that do this bull♥♥♥♥♥♥nowaday"
"Early Access ReviewThis game, like all the other pay to win games, is trash.  It matches you up with people who have so much better cards than you do that you can't hope to win.  It's just like all the other garbage games that let you win by paying real money.  Might as well just play a bunch of stupid games on your smartphone.  Don't waste your time."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt never really feels like you won because you're good at the game and instead it all feels like chance. Some cards seem stupidly overpowered while others are completely useless, and its completely random whether you'll have any good cards unless you dump money into the game. I really want to like this game but it is completely pay to win."
"Early Access ReviewShould be a mobile game, not on steam.  Expeditions are the way to get free cards.  They are poorly designed, tedious, boring, and a waste of time.  Like any free-to-play game, you can expect these massive time sinks to make small gains.  Just charge $10 or something and give me 100% of the content.  I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars of hundreds of hours to get to the same point."
"Early Access ReviewGods I love this game, I truly do, it's fun, the matches are quick and great for a pick up and play, but it is an unstable and buggy mess. Never have I had a game crash on me, or even crash my computer, as often as Minion Masters does. My PC isn't some sort of beast, but it has more than enough horsepower to run this game, and yet after a few games I'll end up joining a match and then my screen goes white and the game dies. Whenever they fix its optimization, I'll happily pick up this game again, but until then I'll have to give it a pass."
"Early Access Reviewpros: addictive and fast paced---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------team battles are the best part about this gamecons:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game punishes you if your teammates leave the game and it also punishes you if you get disconnected before a game even startsyou can't talk to your own god damn teammates which is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, developer is trying to keep every thing g-rated with this hearthstone spinoff of a game chat client is garbage. can't invite people to join your party or anything like that.progression is very very slow (acquiring good cards to compete)any rewards are very small and rather insignificant. Around level 25 you hit a brick wall. Acquiring rubies is next to impossible and the only way to get gold is basically through quests and AI of the unit pathing is super wonky and generally poor. For example you might place a unit with the intention of attacking but it walks away which will lose you games.certain units feel unbalanced only a few masters to choose from and they still need a ton of balancing and variationMatchmaking will pair you with the same person sometimes up to 3 times in a row. This is great if your teammate is good but if he is not you will want to kill your self/ leave the game. If you leave you get a 5 minute ban from match making.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------suggestions: work on the ui, keep balancing units, implement custom matches (more health, no mana, instant cast speed, etc let us choose what we want.) , make reward system way better "
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt is a bit shallow. The sound production isn't very good. And it isn't balanced at all. Too many currencies. Not friendly for beginners.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is a giant ♥♥♥♥ing mess and they actually expect you to pay money to buy this and then pay to win in order to continue playing.♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥You honestly expected that giving people buildings and RNG-based card draws with very little or zero defenses in any deck would be good? Do you know what happens in clash royale when players cant defend a push? They lose.This is like not being able to defend yourself while they continue pouring more and more garbage into your lane that you can't deal with, on top of what you already cant deal with. The cards too entirely too much damage, with very little drawbacks or ways to deal with it. The 'counter this with this' doesn't work when cards shoot half the map and  one shot each other en masse. There is no reason to play this.Don't."
"Early Access ReviewThe Game is fun to the point and i know its alpha but it dosent mean i will take it easy on it for thatWhat will you like:ANIMATION and DESIGN is solid funny ,The units them selfs are interesting they have VARITY in itRNG is pretty fair compared to most gameSCrafting prices are SOLID fineFew solo/tranining  missions are fine (but lacking as daily)What will you hate and hate more:That there is barely any tactics left Some units are way overpowered for their cost,And matchmaking is a joke : Pinnig wood to bronzE leaving wood ranking people with out a chanseDraft mode and confusion: They give you to play Draft Mode one free time but the rest to play again  after  you  lost three matches  you need to pay for it and price really is cosmic 1500g coins or 150 rubies. And for it there is really not that big rewards. Compared to buy a unit you need only 1000gAnd most GOLD GAINED is from level ups and daily quests/challanges  one battle is few gold pieces not even reaching 20IF some one ask if units dosent matter its how you play then thous people are really wrong "
"Early Access Reviewit could be a good game but its not, the new draft mode was where I just couldn't try to like it anymore, it was just lose after lose at a high cost of money, not fun. I guess ths game is not for me"
"Early Access ReviewThis is the worst balanced PvP game I have ever seen, and i'm a nearly 40 year old gamer.Certain heroes are just plain stronger than others, certain hard to get cards out-do every other card that is even remotely similar...the people who created this have no clue how to balance all of the things in their game to make different playstyles possible. You pick the one of the two heroes that are overpowered, then make a deck of the cards that beat anything else and win against anyone trying to have fun.Such a waste."

Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewUnderwhelming fantasy battle game seems to require no skill. The graphics are bad and whether you win or lose seems to be random. I might expect to find this type of game on phones and tablets but not on Steam.
"Early Access ReviewGood game idea, but they failed making it fair. Like many other bad examples on the market these days, you have to play hours before you unlock all kind of good stuff. I don't know why developers think it's a good idea to implement such a mechanic in a competitive game.But even if you unlock all stuff, I'm quite sure you can get a lot of bad games. Because you can always be unlucky in which cards you get to play. Also, I would be really surprised if there are no situations where one deck hard counter another deck.All in all I think frustration is guaranteed."
"Early Access ReviewSo I really love this game, it is fun, its fast and its good to just pick up and play.The only thing I do not like is its Pay to Win! And for a game that in not free to playis pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, Make the game free and have micro transaction, or make people pay for the titleand get rid of it. The amount of people I have played who have spent loads for cards is mad! so untilit changes I will give negative feedback. Will keep playing as its fun, but the gring is slow for so called free players who actually paid for a game in the first place.... madness I know"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAs the developer gives away free keys since closed beta, I feel sorry for people who actually paid for this game.The game it self plays like the mobile game ""Clash Royale"".The mana system feels not really balanced.Some champions are to overpowered against other champions.Also it is pay to win."
"Early Access ReviewThis game sucks some seriousâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ since most builds are exploited for the most part. Not to mention if you are just starting the game, consider yourself â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed becuase most bastards are sitting at that level to get more cards so they can advance. Seriouslyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥game unless you are a masocist. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game and its p2w tatics."
"Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewyes, this game is fun in its own way. i hate this game. to me, there is no strategy. it becomes nothing but spam fest. its ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, but hey give it a try, if you like it. good to you. have fun    (pc version of clash royle, with all the pay to win parts)"
Early Access ReviewBoring magic the gathering wannabe. This should be a mobile game if it isnt already. There is no need for this simplistic cartoon garbage on steam.It took me all of 20 minutes to tell that this game was pay to win.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA classic pay-to-win game obtained from the latest PC Gamer magazine.There's no replayable solo mode, once you're through with that, you won't get any more rewards for playing the same matches. It serves as a testing ground for any new deck concepts you come up with, that's it.The only way to progress is to battle randomly online and specifically win. Which leads to farming the lower ranks so that you can get the coins to buy a new roulette-spin to get more cards.You can, however, pay money for rubies, which you can convert directly into these roulette spins, thus neatly skipping the arduous grinding bit of the game.Daily challenges which also give rewards help to hide these issues, but ultimately this will sit in my 5-minute-game category. "
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe game has a fun take on card battles, and I love the art style. That being said its a game utterly ruined by microtransactions, the most powerful(imbalanced) cards gated behind real money purchases unless you want to spend what is frankly a ridiculous amount of time grinding; its like EA lowkey produced this game. I don't mind supporting good games, but this game is quickly losing my interest simply because I feel i shouldnt have to dedicate a hundred or so hours to unlock just one card."
"Early Access ReviewStupid game. 5 unbeateable deck builds. small kids playing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ no balance. spent a lot of time and money to realize, that developers are doing nothing to stop stupid combos like succubus and spirit infusion and heal and rapmage. really not worth it. another pay to win♥♥♥♥♥♥ no balance updates. only new cards, forcing you to spent money. real dissappointment for everyone, that is not folowing internet unbeatable decks. shame on you developers. 300 cards, and you need only 6 to win it ti the diamond league. buy a pack of jack daniels and never buy this game. it cost me sanity, to try make some universal deck. ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥ i want my money back."

Early Access ReviewThis game is Pay To Win unfortunately. If you got real money to spend you can get the best masters and best cards and all you got to do is get a C2a deck and you are a master at this game. No other strategy to it. A patch to nerf C2a decks went live today and its still OP. This game requires a lot of balancing. I know its Early Access but all I am playing are players that use C2a decks and its really annoying. The whole game is flooded with players playing C2a decks. Very sad.
"Early Access ReviewCurrently has a lot of pay2win (P2W) going.Or lets say its the other way around.You only get cards by opening packs (one random card per pack).Since the packs only hand a rando mcard, you can end up having an account where you get unlucky and unlock stuff you dont need, while all the other players are lucky and get stuff thats suited for the current meta.For example the Anti-Spell Dragon that is widely used because it damages you when you use a spell.I never got that Dragon, although i opened over 130 packs already. and there arent that many cards available at all.And the same goes for several other really useful cards that you NEED to build a proper deck and try different tactics.For example a tactic to send a healer after a tank (which needs you to have the Priestess Card), but you cant do such a tactic without having the cards you need for that.Which means that unless you pay loads of money, you are crippled in your ability to create proper decks, try different tactcis and so limits your freedom.Which would be fine if you could just create a good deck with dumb common stuff.Which you can, but you wont get through the meta that needs you to have at least a few of the legendary cards in the game.Well it can turn out fine.Sadly i am in a spot, where i lack pretty much any of the legendaries you need to get higher in rank, which is frustrating.I also dont have the cards i need to try out fun tactics.Instead the packs i open give me doubles.Oh but you might say ""cant you use the ones you have too often and create a specific card you need?""Well technicly yes. But, a legendary card costs 2000 shards. To get the legendaries i really need to at least be able to do some new (and fun) stuff i would need to have about 8000 shards.Scrapping a legendary gives you about 50 shards.Which means you have to grind packs forever to get enough shards to craft specific rare cards.And obviously you get more of the common stuff to scrap and not legendaries (otherwise i wouldnt have the problem in the first place).Which are at around 15 shards per scrapped card.Fun situation to prove thats a problem:When you get matchmaked in a 2v2 (my team both level 30 and 36) against a level 248 and a level 3, but level 3 somehow has a pure legendary and rare cards deck with all the good stuff.Smurfing and P2W for real (you reach level 3 already with just doing the tutorial).At this point it gets frustrating NOT because other players paid money to be better than you and stronger, but because you have to spend money or otherwise you cant properly choose the cards you need and build a deck.In short, the game is ""pay money for freedom"".Which ultimatively ends up being P2W anyway.At this point  ican only say that the system isnt fun or good.And the monetization could be fairer for all.Make champions paid, make cosmetics paid, make cards unlockable with gold (easy to farm) and allow the player to pick which card he/she wants to buy.Maybe even have the game offer a singleplayer mode (like the expedition and challenges) where you can gather each card that exists once.I personally would buy the new champions, but i wont buy packs and pay into a gambling machine. In the end i would pay 30€ just to get the same legendaries again and obviously all the commons i already own.Wouldnt do that ever. Which means in return, i will also NOT buy a new champion. So they lost me twice with that system.Even if all of the above doesnt apply, its still ""pay money to get a random card in a slot machine (its roulette here)"", which im not up to.And that means, Minion Masters is like all the Mobile Games that are free to play or all these CCG Games on Steam that are free to play. Which is sad as the game itself is actually great to play and fun. Its deep and offers enough freedom to create unique tactics (if you manage to be lucky and get the cards you want/need).As it is though, even with being a good game per se, the macrotransaction gamble system kills it and so it is like all (most of ) the other free to play stuff.A P2W slotmachine."

"Early Access ReviewA pretty interesting game at first, but it really isn't a unique concept. What makes this game not worth getting, however, is the look of this meant to be an F2P. I don't like the fact that you pay for a game, and then there are microtransactions, similar to how EA messed up their Battlefront 2, and I'm pretty sure you (the reader of this review) wouldn't either. Other then that, I can't really come up with a detailed review of this game, so I'll just give a list of Pros and Cons.Pros:(-) Unique minion system where its a deck full of minions instead of a bit of a more limited system like some battling tower defense battling gamesCons: (-) Micro Transactions(-) Can get boring pretty fast(-) Plays more like an F2P game instead of 5$ game"
"Early Access ReviewLet me preface this by saying, I do realise that I only have like less than an hour on this game, and I know that, but I have played it enough to know that it deserves a negative review.My main issue with this game is that it is incredibly pay to win. I got matched up against people who had legendary and supreme cards when I only had really basic cards. As you can probably understand, that doesn't make for a fun time with the game. I did get it refunded because I refuse to support developers who make pay to win games. If they change the business model in the future, I may consider re-buying the game then. But for now I would recommend you stay away from this game, unless you have plenty of money to spend in which case feel free to pick it up. But if you don't have plenty of money to spend, please avoid this game and don't support greedy devs."
"Early Access ReviewI love this game, its a unique card game that used to be fun. Unfortunately despite being free, and the reviews that you see, especially the positive ones about the premium upgrade. Be weary when purchasing the premium upgrade. Even to a person such as myself who truly does enjoy this game feels like i wasted my hard earned money on the upgrade, it is not worth it, does absolutely nothing for you and what it does do, is very little. Yes you get more gold for life, but after you spend youre money, Unless youre a hardcore fan of the game, DO NOT BUY THE UPGRADE. I am not sure if the positive reviews are possibly made by trolls to pretend that it is good. But sorry i will not white lie one of the games i play frequently. I truly wasted my money on the Premium Upgrade. Do not believe the comments about how worth it, that is is. its not. Unless you got 20$ to waste, I could of got a really amazing pizza for 20$, the Premium upgrade left a bad taste in my mouth."

"Early Access ReviewGreat game, but change it to F2P allready, so peoples that have bought it earlier, doenst have card drops anymore.So if you have bought it, and then doenst have play it yet and get your card drop, then you will never get the three card drops sense is F2P, self by the game is first ""release in Q1 2019"", and for ppls that still have gift for this game, then the gift is worthless sense is F2P allready.Can im recommend the game? yes and no, sense is wierd thing the dev are doing in this early access game.Edit.: Im can see that on the page, but really? still long to the release, and ppls still have planty of the gift that are worthless now, sense is a F2P, and on the other site, why change the card drop for who allready have pay for the game? problably a ""steam"" thing that doing it, but still."
"Early Access ReviewWell, it's colorful, it has some dynamic to it but still it looks like a cash sink to me. Trying to play with a basic deck is hard. You have some crappy cards while your enemy has pretty much only the good ones. If you want better cards you know, spend some $ on this game.Oh, and this Protoss Archer master is pretty World-of-Warcrafty in appearance.Idk, probably it's not for me."
"Early Access ReviewStore page mentions coop. After first tutorial battles I see no way to actually check for pve battles even or hell... can't even find a quit button. I guess I have to pay for that too eventually?Well, I would say it could be a fun game if it was a tad less... stupid? Like let me choose what I want to do."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTLDR: Clash Royale + PC = F2P crap in high resolution -> yeah, dont bother.In short: The gameplay mechanics are good - which is kinda like the tower defense and a card game blend,.. BUT the F2P model ruins everything that the game offers.F2P model? for what,.. for a f***ing card game?!The games price and F2PRight now the game is in Early Access and its description says “Minion Masters will be free-to-play in the future""...But that is regarding the price (right now you have to buy a game for 19,99€ witch is so called ""Minion Masters+Premium Upgrade""), but the gameplay already IS free-to-play right now. And you can already see how it ruins the game.The game mechanics* There are ""Minion Masters"" - the one you see on top of each tower in the screenshots, they each have different passive attacks and some buffs. Each one will requere different tactics for you to use.* You activate the cards during the game - it executes a specific attack at the opponent. Each card uses different tactic and needs different amount of time to get ready for use. (and different amount of money / time to unlock just to use it. The same as with minion masters of course. You think you will be good as a Mordar? He costs 1500 blue crystals and 775 rubies, you buy rubies in the shop of course... )Grind and a paywall examplesLook... there are plenty of cards and different Minion Masters for many ways to fight BUT it is all not accessible to you. For about first 1 - 20/25 ""levels"" (which is how many hours you have played) you will unlock cards automatically, but they will noticebly stop unlocking at some point (after level 25 for me) and the most powerful ones you HAVE to grind for.  How much? The most powerful cards (Colosus, Ghost,...) cost 2000 blue crystals -> when you have 1000 gold (you get 4-15 gold after each match) ...you can buy a ""token"" at the shop, so you can roll a random chance of card drop, which you can later scrap for about 50 - (maybe 200 if today is your birthday) blue crystals, depending on how rare the card you have dropped.As a side note: I have ~30 hours playtime and I STILL cant craft not a single 2000 card. Dont forget that you WILL have to craft ""average"" cards too. The ones that you will PROBABLY be good with. Yes you can scrap them later and recraft - but you will lose crystals in the process that way.And of course you can buy tokens at the shop. So you can,.. you know... roll a random chance to drop something you can/need to use during matches. Or just scrap it for 50 blue crystals.The point is you will have to play for DOZENS of hours JUST to get the basic setup. And to get the most powerful cards? I have no idea. For 100+ something hours, I guess. Faster if you pay. You have buy/grind minion masters too. But some of them are sometimes available for free thru ""free week"" or something. How generous.Community now and in the futureIt's not uncommon to rotate thru specific players when you play for 10+ matches.At the end of the december there was ~5 people talking in the global chat. The most activity I have ever seen. Not many people are playing this IMO.Because I couldn't find anyone english speaking to play with a couple days later. Good thing is it will be fixed when the game becomes F2P.There will be plenty of 12 year old kids to have a match with you.At least the community is good right now. "

"Early Access ReviewHorrible mobile-like pay-to-win model on a super dumb down game. Basically, place minion on board and that's it. Do not buy this game, unless you are the kind of person that enjoys a game that requires no skills whatsoever and wants to pay to get the best hand of cards."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewDefinite cash grab as a copy of Clash Royale. Do not buy it unless it's 75% off(5 bucks). I got it for free and I like it well enough, but the game is for sure P2W, just like Clash Royale. These types of games always have greedy business models and this one is no exception. ""Grind for hours upon hours to get one card that is good or just give us 5 bucks and you can have it!"""
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA new  concest... The P2PaPM2W! You don't understand? It means ""Pay to play and pay more to win"". I will always remember my first games where I simply got pwned in chain because my opponents had cards looking quite OP since the beginning...Well, I got it for free, but I'm glad I didn't purchase it."
"Early Access ReviewSuper boring free to play, low skill requirement so I just ran through anybody I played against as I guess people just don't play with hands. I guess it's okay but it's a no from me chief."
Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis is not about skill. Everyone can win because this is a lucky game.I've received it for free but the worst part is that the game costs 20€ and have microtransactions. Guess what? It's P2W!
"Early Access Reviewnice animations and mechanics. i think the card system is appropriate however it straight away invites greed and imbalance.it is centred around rng lootboxes. it is by design a mobile game. it is p2w. as with all mobile games, you need to keep spending. this is not a ""one time purchase"" and you can enjoy the game."
Early Access ReviewGame was fun for the first couple hours and then suddenly it felt like I was consistently getting cheated. I summon a level 9 monster and it gets one shot from a crawling zombie and then they summon a level 3 that tanks hits like no tomorrow for no reason what so ever. Then I incorperate the same cards into my deck and they don't do the same things. Game doesn't explain why things happen the way they do and if there is special reasons why it happens it should be at least explained so the player has a general idea. I'm almost level 30 and still feel like it's 100% RNG. It literally just gives you false hope in the beginning when the game makes sense and then just says screw you and kicks you in the nuts a little ways down the road. I also consistently go against people who are some how able to summon Cleavers what seems like back to back even after I put down numerous disrupters. And no this isn't the mirage ability where it blows up into balloons. I don't know if there's a cheat going around or some kind of exploit but it's impossible to win when someone is capable of limitlessly playing high mana costing cards. Not to mention the archer masters are way over powered. The ability to shoot all the way across the arena is ridiculous. What's worse is they take out your puffs before you even have a chance to do anything. Uninstallin this garbage. Sad cause I liked the game too.
Early Access ReviewAre you a fan of clash royale? *kids screaming yes in the background*Do you want the same♥♥♥♥♥♥and cancer on the pc? *kids screaming yes in the background* say no more
"Early Access ReviewIt's as bad as any other card based game - you need to learn every cards features...Then you need to collect them, then try to make good deck - while using op cards and combos... otherwise you'll keep losing and losing... and rarely you will win, because somehow enemy was worse than you or you countered him with your mindless deck.Game introduces itself very weak... is there any plot? Or it's just mindless less than 10 minutes battles?Game is somehow optimized, but at the same time it is not.Generally I could say that game steals scheme for highly popular multiplayer games - you earn, you unlock, you have divisions, you fight with random people. It rewards you in many ways... and well... has ""victory"" or ""defeat"" signs...That makes me wonder...But no, I do not recommend it to anyone... sorry."

Early Access ReviewIn my opinion this game is basically a clone of Clash of Clans. And I hated every moment playing it. If you want to play a 'clone' be my guest. But I do not recommend playing it.
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewGreat game, unfortunately it has an awful in-game economy, forcing you to grind for weeks in order to get a sizeable collection (roughly 23h hours in game gets you the same content as 4$)."

"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewKewl gameWell I love this kind of games, whatever this is... It relaxes my brain and makes me just play without any stress. Awesome game.. Not worth 20$ tho.."
"Early Access ReviewFun for the first couple of hours,then typical p2win♥♥♥♥♥♥with randon encounters and enemy players who beat you in 30 sec.totally not worth your time or money .. spend 99c and right not sure if it was worth it.oh .. forgot .. totally overcheated and hacked  .."
"Early Access ReviewP2W (Pay to Win) = Garbage---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is garbage! It's not worth a minute of your life. It's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥because to start with there is nothing original. Even being a new game there is nothing original.With the same deck you can win and lose indiscriminately. Your skill won't affect the result of the game. It is a matter of luck. This game will only show you how people who spend money on it win whereas people who are just looking for an original game waste their time and patience. I do not recommend this game to anyone.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Este juego es basura! No vale ni un minuto de tu tiempo. Es un pedazo de ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porque, para empezar no tiene nada de original. Incluso siendo un juego nuevo no hay nada de original.Con la misma baraja puedes ganar y perder indistintamente, tu habilidad no va a declinar la balanza a ninguna de las dos opciones. Es cuestion de suerte. Este juego solo sirve para ver como gente que se deja su dinero gana, y gente que buscaba un juego original pierde el tiempo y la paciencia. No recomiendo el juego a nadie."
"Early Access ReviewNOT WORTH BUYING!Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game like the other fail matchmaking games. its like every 0815 card game you find out there for free, but instead of cards there are brainless minions spawn on a field and run on each overs. they game maybe would be any fun if there where any balancing, but there isnt any. buy the good cards and you win..."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewSomeone randomly gave me this and I was like ""this looks dumb"" but then I tried it and immediately played it for an hour straight cause it's pretty fun.  It's like if in magic the gathering you could actually watch all the monsters fight each other.  Figuring out how to deal with all the insanity that the opponent is throwing at you feels good."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI honestly can't wrap my head around how this game could be enjoyable as a concept. It seems well-made, so credit where it's due. I just don't think there's anything that can be done with the base concept of the game that could make it resemble fun.Then again people seem to really like Hearthstone so I guess maybe I don't understand anything anymore."
"Early Access ReviewPlayed less than 10 minutes, lost interest and tried to exit, THERE IS NO WAY TO EXIT THE GAME without killing the process!We need players online, please don't leave, please, PLEASE!"
Early Access ReviewI dont really suggest it....It clearly is a copy off of Clash royale and that being said it does have its own playstyle but its still a copy nothing more nothing less....You can get some fun out of it if you want to play Clash Royale on pc :l5/10
Early Access ReviewAnything remind me about SJW AND PC culture in a game is a no and virus to me. Aside from that the game is nothing new or remarkable with just ok artwork and ps1 graphic .  It is functional but i can't see any potential.
"Early Access ReviewPros:+addictive and fun at first+nice graphics+fast duelsCons:-so much much much much more frustrating than fun-unbalanced AF and devs don't giva a f*** about that-P2W in it's worst -bugged and glitchy-rigged matchmakingAfter playing this piece of crap for a while I'm absolutely certain that this is one of the worst ""games"" I've ever played. Notwithstanding that it's Early access. Actually, being EA makes it's even worse: you absolutely must not charge money for something as glitchy, buggy and unbalanced as this. It's should be called ""Abuse masters"" because that is all this game is about: you buy a master with easily abusable perks, buy a lot of tokens to get good cards to build abusive deck and there you go. Unless you make mistakes or get matched against another abuser you win everything. That pretty much explains why devs don't bother about balance: normal players come and go, they are just ""meat"" for abusers, who pay money and get what they want.     Every few dozens of mathes you just get disconnected and lose. Every few team macthes your teamate leaves or disconnects and you lose. As soon as you manage to get a small winstreak you get matched with abusers and get a 5-10 game lose strick. Better avoid this lame trash before you get addicted. ""Devs"" who make ""games"" like this should be banned from Steam and gaming industry forever.1000000000000000000000000000 lame greedy devs out of 10.Update: finally I'm done with this sh-ty excuse of a game! Recent update brought a rework of Expeditions and made them essentially useless. Before this rework you could get a lot out of expedition: random cards, several tokens, resources and a lot of gold. And that allowed you to catch up at least a little to those who bought Premium and donates for resources. Now all you get is a small amount of gold + 1 token and you can do only 1 expedition per week. P2W of this game  reached a new hight.Devs are too pu$$y to push any actual changes this game needs in balance, matchmaking or anything, since in their opinion this game needs more players first. So it's up to players to deal somehow with all that buIIsh*t that's going on. And this game's community is absolutely the worst gathering of the worst scumbags I've ever seen in Steam yet. Cause every f-ng abuser scum thinks he is cool and ok just because devs allow it. Notorious for it's toxicity communities of Dota 2 and CS:GO seem rather nice and friendly after this s**thole. F**k this sh*t, I'm out!"
"Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewpretty good game, but dota 2 is better, and its free so i would rather recommend dota 2 because a free to play game saves ur money....but dont hate me plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz                       ......        ........                       ......        ........                            \........../"
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewA game like this has no place being on Steam, especially for its given price. I received this game for free and even so, I feel scammed. Minion Masters had meager strategy, little depth, and its gameplay was atrociously dull. If you wanted to play Clash Royale, you can do so for free on mobile, making this game's existence redudant."

"Early Access ReviewNice looking game, Fun to play, and good for time passing with your friends. If you Love playing games on mobile.. definetly you gonna love this on big screen.. :) "
"Early Access ReviewI think for the time period, I like this game.PROS :- Good Background Music- Nicely detailed characaters- Nice Graphic detailingCONS :- Some units are too opped and require some tweaking.- Not enough arenasFor now i think this game is playable."
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIm not so much into card games, but I got this for free and tried it. I can't say that it's not good. I believe people who like these type of games will have a good time playing.What I fear is that the game might evolve into a p2w type with microtransactions. "
Early Access ReviewAfter logging many more hours I have come to the conclusion that this game is definitely fun. The game provides a interesting turn on a card-based game. I do apologize for the negative review and I hope that this game gets recogniton for being so entertaining.
"Early Access ReviewThe game is great.. But most of the time i play against other players i lose because, its either im noob or you aren't matched with those players with the same skill set as yours. (level) or their just good.. I recommend this game. I didn't play it much but i had great times when i was playing the game..  Maybe ill come back once early access is gone, so that i can update my review and make it 5x longer. Bai~ "
Early Access ReviewAwesome Game that is Clash Royale Style bot i myself prefer this game over clash royalePros- Good Graphics- Balanced Cards- Good Variety In Cards- Got Steam Traiding Cards- Nice Multiplayer- Not that much P2W - Steam AchivementsCons-MicrotransactionsScore 7.5/10
"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI've only played about an hour of this game but it is amazing. It is graphically astounding and very addictive gameplay wise. I recommend this game to anyone that likes little things to pass the time, or anyone that likes MOBA's. This game is basically a multiplayer tower defense where you strategically play different cards that summon minions to stop the opponents minions from reaching your tower."
"Early Access ReviewIt's fun for a bit. The single player challenges against the AI are fun, but the game is horribly unbalanced. The cost for a single spin to get a new card (1 random card) is 1,000 gold. Each match you get about 20-30 gold. So it quickly become a grind for new cards (with average match length it's about 2.5 hours to get a card). Online play is not really diverse and everyone is using the same cards and the same strategies. It is apparent that this game is heavy focused on pay-to-play crowds and if you are playing F2P you are going to not succeed in playing online or against the AI. It's a fun game for a bit, but honestly you might be better off either waiting to see if the game develops more or playing something else. This game isnt even worth installing."
"Early Access ReviewCool mechanics, cool heroes, cool cards BUT:- waaaaaaaaay too many duplicates in chests (i opened like 30 chests with my hard earned gold, 10 of which were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ duplicates, all while missing more than half of the collection),- not F2P friendly (while legendaries don't win games on their own once you know the cards they definitely give you an edge over an equally skillful opponent - ghost, troubadur, serpent, just to name a few-,- the disenchant / craft values are awful as expected (almost as bad as in Hearthstone)I like the game but it feels like yet another grindfest...still recommended if you're willing to pour some money into the game.6/10 as F2P, 8,5/10 as a paying customer."
"Its Middle Earth, What else can you ask for? I will admit its not what is was long ago, before FTP before it was on steam. but its MIDDLE EARTH!!!!! nothing better then exploring and recognizing places you have read about."
"Aside from having aged a bit roughly and not entirely Steam Controller compatible plus a bit of a grind and the in game store purchase model of fragmenting content (which if you were lucky and aware of the fact the  previous developers twice allowed a Lifetime VIP account including monthly complementary in game store credit versus monthly subscription model)  it makes up for the current in game trend of purchasing content separately for the sake of progression. All in all, a wonderful lore based MMO for those who love high fantasy and the world of Tolkien. Glad it is still online and hope it continues far beyond the War of the Ring and into uncharted parts of Middle-earth for many years to come."
"Fantastic MMO to play Solo or with friends. Everyone in the community is very helpful and friendly. Don't be afraid to ask for a helping hand from a stranger, most are more than willing to help newer players progress through the game."
"Been playing this game for over a decade. Has something for everyone. A very doable learning curve without being boring. Easy to learn without losing it's challenge aspect. A lot to do, accomplish and experience. I'd highly recommend it for teens to adults...very entertainimg."
"I wanna preface this by saying I've been playing since Mines of Moria was out, so it's been a long ride. I encourage you to read this review all the way through. It will be quite long, but I will try to give as close to an unbiased opinion as I can. I have sunk in a little over a year though across all of my characters though. When I discuss the story aspect, I will try to be as spoiler free as possible.LotrO is a pretty unique MMO as it stands. The biggest appeal for most is that they get to play in Tolkien's world. Most of the people I've interacted with ingame or observed in the server wide chat share this sentiment. Recently with the release of the Legendary servers, which are progression servers NOT classic servers, many people have come to revisit Middle-Earth or give it a try. We're going to cover the bad before the good.--The Bad--It's a very old game. It struggles a lot with some graphical settings. For instance, the game tends to crash more often when using DX11 instead of DX9. I was have many crashes in certain areas of the game when running DX11, Bree and Minas Tirith for instance. The game still looks pretty good when you drop down to DX9. Another setting would be the engine speed in Troubleshooting. For me it was defaulted to Very High, and lowering it to High helped with stability.The F2P aspect. This game has both a subscribtion option - referred to VIP status and a Free to Play option which labels your account either Free to Play or Preminum. As a new player, if you do not buy a sub to become VIP, you are Free to Play. If you are a Lifer or former VIP and let your sub run out, you are downgraded to Premium. If you purchase something from the store, LotrO Points as an example, you are upgraded permanently to Premium. I won't go into detail about the differences between the account types as they are easily searchable and more clearly defined than I write. F2P itself isn't bad, but if you really intend to play this game for any length of time as a F2P player, I would 100% recommend subscribing for 1 month and logging into every character you can possibly make so that they unlock all of their trait slots AND Swift Travel (which is instantly traveling from one zone to another without having to sit and watch the horse gallop) permanetly on those chracters. Cancel the next day or whenever you want, but it is super helpful and beneficial in the long run. Plus any character that gets to Level 20 during your subscribtion can unlock the ability to use mounts instead of spending 95 LotrO points per character.The LotrO Store. I both like and dislike the LotrO Store. So the store sells cosmetics, store exclusive mounts, instance unlock packs(3-man and 6-man dungeons, Raids, skirmishes (like scenarios from WoW), quest regions, expansions, additional bag space (you start with 5 bags), trait slots if they are not already unlocked, ability to use mounts, EXP boosts, an item to disable XP, Main Stat Tomes (for a negligable stat bonus, but worth mentioning), and other similar items. Ingame, there is the deed system, which awards the player LotrO points ingame for killing X amount of specific creatures, reaching certain levels of reputation, discovering X amount of areas, and completing X amount of quests in addition to other more complicated deeds. This means that IF you don't want to spend money IRL and have lots of free time, you CAN THEORETICALLY grind the LotrO Points to buy whatever you want. I myself stopped having a subscription after the first Rohan expansion was released and bought every quest zone/expansion afterwords with points that I had accumulated from my different characters that I messed around on with the exception of Mordor.PVP. Non existant. PvMP(player vs. monster player) is mostly dead (due to how stats are currently) and the system is really weird, if you are looking for a PvP game, it isn't this. For reference, the highest rank I achieved in PvMP was rank 5, Sergeant of the Guard, which is out of a total of 15 - the highest. It didn't take very long for 5 but takes exponentially longer to go up. Feel free to try it. PvMP requires a VIP subscription.--The Good--The music is phenominal in my opinion. The tracks feel like the fit well with the environment and many will make you reminesce about the LotR movies. I usually mute ingame sounds when playing MMOs, but when I play LotrO I don't. It has some really memorable tracks, and Moria has the best music hands down. There is also an ingame music system that people use to put on concerts ingame and it's always a blast to hear some good tunes.Alternative routes. For a portion of the game, you have more than 1 path you can take to go through a set of levels. For levels 1-15 you can either do Ered Luin, the Dwarf/Elven starter area, the Shire(Hobbits), or Archet/Combe (Men, also a small part of Bree. Once you hit level 15, you are sent to Bree until about level 20ish, and that's where it opens up again. For levels 20-30 you have two zones to pick from, the Lone-Lands or the North Downs. For 30-40 you have Evendim or the Trollshaws. For 40-50 you have Forochel, the Misty Mountains, Angmar, and Eregion in the mid 40s. Once you hit 50 you delve into Moria and then Lothlorien. At 60 you can either go to Southern Mirkwood or Enedwaith. There are a few similar choices as you move forward, although Rohan is the only real option for 75-95. Gondor opens up for a long stretch and there are several zones dedicated to level 100 alone and through to Mordor at 105. TL;DR many zones to try differently as you level.The Warden Class. As a friend of mine described it, a class that is similar to a fighting game character as far as moves go.The Story. From the intro you are a stronger than average Free-Peoples of Eriador/Middle-Earth. As you progress through the game's story more and more of your actions and deeds spread and people are empowered by your presence. As you progress through expansions or different lands, sometimes people have heard whispers of your name, sometimes they don't know who the hell you are. By the current end, you are a figure that has been at critical events in Middle-Earth, not always directly in the center of.The story is seperated into Volumes. Once you finish the intro you begin Volume 1, which covers the ""vanilla"" story. You meet with central characters from the books and then aid the people of Eriador. Volume 2 extends through the first and second expansions - Moria and Mirkwood. Volume 3 deals with the next three expansions, Isengard and both sections of Rohan. Volume 4 deals with Gondor. So far, things that happen after the events of the Return of the King is titled The Black Book of Mordor and deals with events AFTER the triology. As of the writing of this review, Update 23 has released up to Book 8 of the Black Book.The PvE content is there, and I have a lot of memorable times running dungeons and raids. Some of the older content scales up to level cap, which is nice to run some of the older pieces of content. One of my favorites is Barad Guldar from Mirkwood, where you siege a fortress and eventually have a rather epic fight on the top of the fortress. Most content has a few different difficulties. Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 2 Challange( which requires something specific to be done in addition to Tier 2). I haven't played through the most recent raid, but having played most of what is available, there are some very interesting encounters.-------TL;DR - While being F2P and an older game, it is quite enjoyable and with the release of Legendary servers it has breathed new life in a community sense with everyone together once again - new players and old. While there are a few issues with the game and the store, IF you are a Tolkien fan and you are desiring to immerse yourself in a world that has interesting questlines and a friendly community - go for it. LotrO is a game I've always come back to over the years.Solid 8/10 game."
"Interesting, catching, funny and kind of comfortable game with great graphics and really nice community. If you want to spend some time living your Tolkien dreams, talking to awesome people, questing and deeding and crafting and roleplaying, this is just the game for you.Main towns and cities are well-arranged (no big chance to get lost, like I did many times trying to play Dungeons and Dragons), there's efficient navigation, quest tracking system and game guide, smooth and sensitive movement control (I don't get why it's so hard to turn in World of Warcraft or Age of Wulin, but perhaps it's my PC's fault), skill queue, automatic movement towards target (e.g. an ore deposit or a vendor) by right-clicking it and it's easy to get around an object in your path without turning (you just kind of slip around, hardly ever get stuck). Game has a honed race and class system, you can chose from basic to advanced difficulty classes and from 3 trait trees focusing on different skills and have real fun figuring out how to fight best. You can buy your own house, have fun with decorating it, store stuff in the chest (purchaseable space), exhibit your trophies. Crafting is easy and various, crafted items are usually far better than any you can buy (except the stock of the Auction House, where you can put something for sale yourself if you have free slots - VIPs get 30, Premium 5). There are many events where you can win great prizes, you can gain reputation with many societies and get privileges and awesome unique items, you can even chose to play the bad guys (Creeps) and create an orc or warg or spider and fight PvP against the Free Peoples (Freeps) at level 85. In the LOTRO Store you can buy whatever you like for real money, there's a great choice of buffs, additional slots (trait slots, inventory bags, chatacter slots,..), steeds, outfits, quests packs and more. It's not even necessary to use real money - you can earn Turbine points used in the Store by finishing deeds (it's slow, but hey - who gives you something for free these days?).When you're lost, you can always turn to the LOTRO-Wiki, there's usually everything you need to complete any quest or deed, even when you feel it's impossible to figure one out. And if not Wiki, you can get some answers from other players on the Advice chat channel. LOTRO's community is one of the kindest, most generous and most obliging in the gaming world.It's kind of comfortable to play this game, it's thrilling, sometimes scary, often funny and not always trivial. You don't have to quest and level, you can just relax and roleplay or craft or hunt materials, money and reputation. You can freely use the chat to meet great new people, join kinships and fellowships and have plenty of fun socializing. And beware - it's very addictive ;)."
"i am new to this game and i already love it!, the worlds are done really well, theres lots of character coustomization options,  theres lots of npc fights, i absolutely love it, good for longtime fans of LOTR and people who have never made any relationship with it!"
"Bought a lifetime sub when this released, and I have never regretted it. The games still looks good, although in 2017 the visuals are getting a bit dated (although the water effects were mind blowingly awesome when it first came out).  There's loads to do, and a more mature community than many MMO's, and it's chock full of Tolkien lore!"
11 years and still going strong. It's amazing that they keep putting out expansions for this game. This is the most immersive MMO I've ever played and nearly 12 years later it still draws me back. The memories it has instilled run deep.
"LOTRO is the first F2P MMORPG I've played so far, coming from time spent in both FFXIV:ARR & WOW. LOTRO is a visual drop from FFXIV & play-mechanics much closer to WOW. But, it has a rich, robust content & lands to explore from the epic writings of JRR Tolkien. Your character(s) exist in a beautifully realized Middle Earth at the height of the ""War of the Ring"". Co-existing with many other player characters, trading, crafting, making music & celebrating together, joining Kinships, and fighting along-side one-another in epic battles together.  Technically speaking, LOTRO is really free-to-play, you earn & bank ""Lotro Points"" by grinding through content, completing Deeds in game, & those can be spent in the ""LOTRO Store"" to buy all manner of QoL (Quality-of-Life) enhancements, Traits, Skills, quest-packs, and even full game expansions. But, I DO mean GRIND, so much so that, if you have the funds available (i.e. not terminally poor), you'll typically give in and either spend real-money to buy items in the LOTRO Store or subscribe to monthly ""VIP"" subscriptions (which includes many of these items automatically, excluding expansions). Use the fair F2P model to get in the door, grind to earn ""LOTRO Points"" to buy your 1st couple QoL enhancements to make your game experience better. Then, if you like what you see, consider laying out some of your hard-earned cash to buy or subscribe to more of the LOTRO experience. So, if you are a LOTR fan & the idea of playing a MMORPG isn't odious to you, it's a no brainer, the choice is yours, no one controls the destiny of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth, the darkness cannot sway you… Come join us & play LOTRO, ""Welcome friends!"""
"was my first MMORPG ever. (I have played a lot of others too)  Played since Mirkwood days, and still enjoy playing this game a lot (for some reason). Although it's not the most amazing looking game by comparison to a lot of games these days, but it has its own charm, which definitely wins my heart. Highly recommended to all Tolkien fans."
"I LOVE this game, It was one of my first games and still one of my favorites to this day. I admit, if you haven't played for a while, It will take a LONG time to load, that's the only thing I would try to fix about about LotRO."
"I've been playing this game since the summer of 2012 (though only just recently through Steam), and it is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and most certainly one of my favorites. The world is so massive and fun to explore, all the quests are enjoyable and I actually want to do all the side quests, and the story quests are really engaging. At many points I find myself wanting to know what happens next. The lore of Middle-earth is very well represented, and the game feels very true to the source material, even though it does take liberties, as one would expect. The community is a good one, and you can almost always find somebody in-game to help you out. Even when you can't, for the fellowship quests you just have to gain a few more levels and it's definitely within reach. Of the nine classes I've played (all but the Lore-master) they're all unique and fun to play. The Hunter in particular is a good beginning class, since it has a wide range of ranged and melee skills, and the quick travel skills are lifesavers. I'm only at level 70 on my main character, and that's exactly the sort of pace this game requires: nice and easy. It's a game that really draws you in, and even when I'm not actually doing a quest or deed or other objective, I still love just going around and exploring the Middle-earth Turbine has created for their game. I cannot stress the beauty of the game enough. Each and every area is unique and beautiful. From the rural hills of The Shire, to the torch lit caverns of Moria, each new vista amazes. I can't wait to see where my adventures will take me next!Overall, not only is this a great MMO, it's just a great all-around game, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in the world of Middle-earth."
"Wonderful if you have a computer that will run the graphics well, but even for computers that have to have lower settings in graphics, it still allows the user to play the game like everyone else. It's very lore-friendly and I definitely recommend it. Got hooked on it and have been playing since then."
"“Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.”― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings"
"i Have played this game for 5y and loved it. Im one of the rare ones who wants to complete everything, deeds and quests. I have yet to make it to end game content that way, but when i do get there I will have a very solid character for running group difficult stuff.This game has so many layers to it, old tolkien lore that was never used in the movies, achievment process for all kinds of unique things and items, intracite puzzles and group 'dungeons' (instances) that are challenging even if you are over level for the content. There are custimizable wardrobes far beyond anything i've seen in other games, pets, horses, collectables for all kinds of things: even maps of the world.If you want a game you can beat in a week, of all content, and reach the end in raid lvl gear, get out. if you want a mind game with lore and ancient history to every stone u can see, join here. a whole world is waiting to intice you."
If your like me a lover of The Lord of the Rings movies and have seen the animated movies from the 1970's. You will love this game. You don't have to be an expert on everything Tolkien however all over the place are references to lore from what was wrote to real life places where J.R.R. Tolkien visited.
"This game was decent from when it was released all the way into the Isengard expansion. Now the developers have left it and the game is mainly based on solo play. Along with that, it says Free to Play but unless you're willing to put about 100+$'s down on this game you won't see it to its end if that. There are many more Lotr games and MMO's that are better than this one so i wouldn't waste your time.Update 2 years later: New devs have taken over the game and the people at Standing Stones are doing a great job releasing content to the game. Game is headed in the right direction as of right now. As for the previous things said: the game is still expensive as far as how much money it takes to own the entire game, however you can gain a lot of Lotro Points early game which allows you access a lot of the content. If you're looking to live a life in Middle-Earth i'd recommend it, but as a MMORPG I would not (espcially if one is looking for pvp).Final review thoughts from Update 23: I've had this game set as not recommended for some time now and after playing through SSG's most recent update it will stay that way permenantly and heres why. I've played this game for 9.5 years now and have watched it go from a subcription based game and also watched it go through two development teams. Each expansion brought a new tool to the game that could be used past that expansion and scaled in level allowing players to experience content no matter where they were in the world. Moria brought us Legendary weapons, Mirkwood brought us Skrimishs, Isengard brought us powerful dungeons and more raids that will always be remembered, East rohan brought us mounted combat, and Helms Deep brought us Big Battles( a tool that continued to be used until the end of Minas Tirith. All these things along with crafting and doing dailies allowed for so many options for players to equip themselves with gear they needed to take on the end-game content. As seen in my previous update, I had high hopes for Standing Stone Games when they took over my beloved MMORPG and started releasing content. On the surface I saw a lot of content being put out, however having played through it now I can see how bad the situation is. SSG has ignored all previous tools now that scaled with the player level leaving you to only play their new content which is typically broken for months. Many loot tables are out dated and dropping level 105 gear (which is where Turbine left off) and others are dropping 120 as a bug that won't get fixed until months from now. Aside from the bugs the scaling is completly messed up in that lvl 50 characters are 3 manning 12-man raids, and lvl 120 characters can struggle with lvl 105 raids. Ontop of all the problems this game has at end-game right now, they decided to jump on the WoW bandwagon and create a ""Legendary"" Server which is supposed to be the games' classic server. But its not a classic server, its just an identical live server with a level restriction on it. This means it uses the modren classes, skill trees, Lotro store, travel systems, instance finder, etc. This is the biggest cash grab ever since they added lootboxes in the game that drop better gear rather than cosmetics. SSG decided what they produced was so bad in comparision to the rest of the game that the game was better off when Turbine was developing it, so they created servers just for their content. Lotro was fun back in the day, but now its just a monotized focused game that has left so many things behind that the only thing keeping this game alive is J.R.R. Tolkien."
"Still, after 9 years since game has been lounched it's one of the best mmorpg's ever made. Only the fact, game is still active, with still added content make this game such as unique as every mmo player need. I have played since closed beta, now i have over 1600 hours spent in this game (counted ingame time), my guild is still active after that much years after. Yes, only with a few elder members, but still .. Graphics dont look like an high end title, but ye ... it still isn't trash.  Much of key features fot times when game was new, like hobbies, great farming, nice crafting, exping of weapons, raising your own horse, housing for everyone not only for high lvl players. A lot of games after has tried to use these philosophies from lotro with theyr own little inovations.  It's the only mmorpg what i have still instaled, all these 9 long years and i'm still loging back. Not for long gaming sessions, I'm now 32 years old grandpa :D But for strong bond with this game, great sceneries, lovely soundtrack and a cup of nostalgia for sunday afternoons. I know, for today's young players is a lot of new games for chose from, with high end graphics etc. But in this game, you've got 9 years of ading quest with no ""clicktobehighestlvl"" like in wow = months of questing, months of collecting, months of making deeds, months of making your unique named and stated weapon, etc. Try it with your friends for the best experience. I will put my arm into Saurons fire if it will not be fun for you."
"This game was my childhood.Lord of the rings was a great movie series and an even better book, It's really neat that they made it into an online game that you can play with your friends."
"By far my favorite MMORPG, especially since it stays so true to Tolkien's lore. The pricing models for quest packs, expansions, and other purchaseable materials are also fairly reasonable. 10/10"
"Not much needs to be said about this game. It is an MMO - my first MMO - and it has a vast universe that takes up all of the time in the physical world to explore (obviously an exageration). I logged days into this game and even enjoyed the thrill of teaming up with friends, either through LAN parties or just over the internet at seperate houses. If you are new to MMO's or just really like them, give it shot, this one may surprise you.4/5"
"I started my lotro journey right around the time Rise of Isenguard came out (before it was on steam, dont let the 104 hours fool you ive played much longer). To this day, lotro was the best mmo experience ive ever had. However, its not the same game it used to be. Now, some of the reasons I stopped playing before (though after writting this review I've logged 44 more hours into it) might be reasons someone else might enjoy it (such as the ease of lnadscape content). Since i mentioned it, ill start with the landscape content/mobs. Back in the day, landscape content wasnt something you powered through solo on any class, with little interaction between yourself and other players, it was challenging (in spots) and for portions of it you needed to team up providing a great way to meet new friends. Again, the ease of landscape content (and the ability to power through it) might be a plus in some players eyes (those tho like the modern setup of blitzing to endgame) but not for me. The other thing that disenchanted me with this game is the lack of grouping.Now, dont get me wrong, you wont have a problem getting groups for endgame. The gear grind means you will find plenty of group action at endgame, but for those who like to run instances on-level, the action isnt really there. Yes, you can spam in the world chat for 15-30 minutes and perhaps get a party but its not going to be something you can count on. Again, this isnt a problem if you prefer the solo grind to endgame but I dont.Now, with my biggest negatives out of the way, I would 100% still recomend this game to anyone who loves Lord of the Rings, or anyone looking for a classic style mmo, or even anyone who's never tried it. This game is a tolkien lovers wet dream. While the graphics arent beautiful or anything, the world is breathtaking. This wouldnt be a complete review if I didnt mention one of the best things about this game, kinships and the community. Kinships are nothing new, they're your guild/clan/ect in other mmos. What makes them special in this game is the community. There are kinships to help new players, kinships for roleplaying, kinships for endgame, and everything in between. The community itself is one of the nicest, most helpful, mature gaming communities ive ever been a part of. The community is one of the big reasons I will never be truly done with this game until its closed down.TL;DR: Its aged (like us all amiright?), for the most part well, has its problems (nothing super major) but is still one of the best MMOs out there, in this humble swordsman's opinion. Well worth a download. (Side note: Go in to this game expecting to pay money or grind A LOT [as in a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton] to get beyond the f2p content. By the time you need to you should know if you want to spend money to keep playing. Pro tip: buy the quad pack on sale to get 4 of the expansion packs for dirt cheap, then you only need a couple of quest packs and the last two expansions to go all the way to endgame. Also, paying for one month of VIP and then [optionally] canceling it is well worth it.)"
"The game is dated, that's for sure... However...As a Lord of the Rings fan this game is a way of stepping into the world of the books and movies with detail payed to the lore. A well worth it experience for fans. The graphics still are breathtaking at times even for the games age and the gameplay is an experience. But seriously the Riders of Rohan.....Just.....Do IT!"
"Ok, this game is awesome. Really good multiplayer and brilliant prologue, however it is quite long and there are some other features that are a little annoying. for instance the money cap when you are not a premium member. Also the fact you can't sell multiple things in auctions, as a free to play person. Being a premium member unlocks many perks and i reccomend getting premium to get all features."
"This game is so much better than runescape, just got all the dlc and I'm having fun you guys should try this. People are very nice and very helpful. The only downside to this game is the quest pack. i suggest to buy the Quad pack which is from level 50-85. I give this a 8.5/10 (*RECOMMENDED FOR MMO/RPG PLAYERS*)"
"This game only has end game PVP which is kind of sad.. but hey not every game can have the best pvp.. This game is very easy to play casually..  gave me a nice break from DOTA 2..  oh i am in the middle of the game but i can get up and run to the store without having to wait 45 more minutes.. ahh refreshing.. it is labelled free 2 play..  but to make yoru hero strongers with traits and such you will need to use Turbine Points which you earn by playing.. but again its easier to just buy them..  certain areas of the game you need to unlock and you can with turbine points but ALOT so that might require purchasing the expansions..  then gain you could keep playing for free until you have enough points to buy it.. over all the game reminds me of Dark Age of Camelot.. the graphics and play style.. even though the graphics are a bit dated they still look very nice and will play on most machines, laptops.. you might can even play this on a windows based tablet for that matter..  its a decent game..  though i am only mid level ..  its been fun so far.."
iv play this since release i use the none steam luncher tho it a great game and has 1000 of hours of game play i know becaaue 2 off my guy alone are over 1400 hours of game play crafting got the extra craftign crit for better item in the crafting lv you doing a good feature and the vip rewards are good to the new talent the pvp monster zone great fun running in a wolf pack or any off the other monsters
This Game is extremely fun. And is never dull. The games strong point is the story line that is similiar to the one that token created in the lord of the rings. It is no where near as rift. but nothing ever will be. but it is still really fun to play!
"Though it's old this is a very beautiful game. And it is very true to Tolkien's world of middle earth. So as a Tolkien fan I would recommend this game just for the world alone. I will never forget the first time I saw Weathertop or entered the mines of Moria.The quests have a feel of old MMOs. They can be rather grindy at times. But the main (epic) quest line is very well written and pulls you into the game. Makes the lesser and more grindy quests bearable. I would highly recommend reading the quest text of the main quest line as it really makes the game so much better and creates a lot of immersion. The community in the game is very nice and helpful. I don't know if it's because I play on a RP server, but I have never been trolled or anything for asking a question on world chat. People just seem very friendly and helpful. The auction house is pretty empty and often also overpriced. But asking in chat you never have to wait long to find someone willing to sell what you're looking for. "
"Personally, I love this game. I'm quite biased because i'm a nerd for anything related to Tolkien's work, but, this MMO is so immersive and fun; a friendly community and active player base. If you're looking for a good Middle Earth game, this is it."
"I brought like 20 friends to this game, we got a kingship, we have our own way of electing fellowship leaders which can lead us where they want, and its free (for the most part). Great game i give 9/10!"
"Right off the bat I must recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs! I donâ€™t role-play that much, I mainly play CS: GO but to get away from the fast pace style of CS go this game is so relaxing yet with a twist of battle that I need in an RPG. Cut to the chase, itâ€™s free. Ya donâ€™t like it...delete it. Just try it out instead of reading my ðŸ’© review of this aw3s0m3 game."
Playing this game for almost 5 years now and i'm really satisfied. New content is delievered on regular basis. It's good game if you are exploring type and Tolkien nerd or competative player looking to be top class. Overall very good game.
"Product received for freeI had to revise my review .After playing the game fpr approximate 1600 hrs, I am very dissapointed in the game. I play the HUNTER {best fighter}. After so many hrs., they decide to REVAMP the game, completely demoting the hunter. Why they did this I don't know. The hunter no longer have that power shot and without it he or she become easy pray. I became a VIP because of the hunter and now I afraid I must cancel my subscription. Good job whoever you are. I'm sure all those hunters out there, feel the same way. It was a wonderful game......."
"I'll admit, I haven't played many MMOs, but LoTRO is one of the best that I've played. You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game. Another clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use ""Turbine Points"". How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world. There is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot.In short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.PRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria."
"What most people on the negative reviews forget is that this game was officially released on 24 April 2007 and then it was added on steam on 6 June 2012.This is a great MMORPG and it was one of the best at the time, right now it's still a great game. Most people think they will be playing the same story as the one that goes on the movies but that's completly incorrect and if you are thinking of playing this game with that mindset please look for another game.You get to explore Middle Earth with your own Character, class and Race. Yes, you do have to walk alot but that's the same in 99% MMORPG's', you have a Sh*t Load of quests, easy crafting method, season events all year long (Summer and Christmas Festivals are a few examples), alot of raids/instances to go through with your friends and/or party. A good Kinship(Guild) system that makes sure there are no empty guilds taking up names, simply said you need a total of 8 players if you want your kinship to stay ""alive"".In terms of gameplay it's very similar to World of Warcraft (remember SIMILAR NOT EQUAL), pvp included and focused on certain locations.This game used to be pay to play, now it's free to play but fortunatly not pay 2 win, the shop only gets you items that you can use while lvling(not the most powerfull just average), cosmetics but you can get your own while you play the game and participate in festivals. You need to buy the riding token from the shop but that's nothing to worry about because some of the quests you will be doing will give you premium money allowing you to not only get the Riding skill but also purchase every other item AND Expantion through the online LOTRO shop.Overall this is still a great game, just depends on how you look at it, so don't go comparing it with the story of the movies......"
"FOR ALL YOU NERDS WHO LOVE ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS"", GET THIS! I love this game. All of your Middle-Earth fantasy have come true. This game's combat is not that great but it doesn't matter if you love the work of this Godly man named Tolkien. There is so much to do but the lore of this game is fantastic, and the world continuosly is updated and more stuff is added. There is also an incredibly friendly community here!"
"What can be said of LOTRO (Lord of the Ring Online)... but addictive!!The possibility for character creation are close to endless with race, character class, and profession!I for myself, added some regions for diversity of adventure !!Give it a try, it cost nothing..."
"As a huge fan of LOTR and JRRT's world in general, I was looking forward to playing this game as soon as it was announced. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it installed for a very, very long time until Steam came over to Russia. Now I had my chance to play and form my opinion. I really liked the graphics - much better than I expected. The mapping of the world is nicely done, lots of great and beautiful locations, and an interesting storyline too. At first, that is. Unfortunately, it all gets rather dull as you have to perform tons of similar quests to get that XP and get stuff without paying money for it. Because, truth be told, all this game does (like any ""free"" online game) is try and squeeze money out of you. You can play without it, but it's much more difficult and in the end it gets plain boring because you can't level up fast enough to keep up with the main quest, so you're stuck will all the small quests all over the place. It also takes you plenty of time to go places, from location to location, from quest to quest. There are lots of servers, and I played on Landroval which has plenty of players. However, it's still difficult to find people for team quests as they're so busy running around with their own quests. In the end it gets rather annoying when you just need to find one item and you're killed right in the tomb's hallway or something. The thing I loved were the holidays, all the challenges were fun and rewards worthy. And the good spirit of competition, too! All in all, I would recommend this game, though it's individual whether you keep playing or get bored at some point. I know I'm not the most patient person - with Lineage II I quit at lvl 69, and here the maximum is a 100... I surely do have better things to do with my life;)))"
"I played this game on and off for about 3-4 years roughly. But I don't play this game vary often. It is a good standard MMO based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world that brings old Celtic and Norse Mythology into today's lores. The game is much bigger since I started playing it sometimes, and there can be much to do in this game. Play the main story, practice your toon or character's crafting skill, go fishing, chat with other players in the game about whatever if they're willing and in the mood, or just roam around this mini version of Middle Earth like a Hobbit without a hill or a Dwarf without a Mountain.To put the rest in short, the community is good depending on server, the gameplay is good, and it does have a serious pvp community even though this has lost some participation compared to a few years ago. The only drawback to this game is the ftp option feels more like a free sample than free to play. It's allot like Star Wars the Old Republic with micro buying. So its still technically pay to play like WoW, but one can still have fun with the ftp option. It's just not as generous as Star Trek Online or Rift.So yes I would recommend this game to nearly anyone."
"Lore-coherent quest narrative in one of the most immersive MMO worlds you can immerse yourself in. Meet your favourite characters, in the most beautiful places Middle Earth can offer. For free.Just don't expect innovative gameplay mechanics."
"This Game is well,in one word, Masterpiece.It opens the user to the whole middle earth whether you watch the movies read the books its lord of the rings you people know the deal. This game is perfect, Every Fan Of Lord of the Rings should play it."
"Overall, I'd say this game is a lot of fun. Sure, you have to pay for a lot of the (high lvl) content, but its a very well made game that you can put a lot of hours into without even paying. Its a very relaxed environment with a great community to back it up, If you like the community/roleplay aspects of MMOs then this game is for you."
"The lord of the Rings online is a pretty rock solid MMORPG.Players will find themselves dropped right into the action of middle earth regardless of what type of character they decide to play. The events of the Lord of The Rings Online (LOTRO) follow the events of the films as your character follows in the wake of the fellowship to aid the free peoples of middle earth against the forces of sauron.Players can choose a host of Classes Ranging from DPS to Tanks to Healers or support. The list of all classes is listed below.Guardian-----TankWarden------TankChampion----Melee DPSHunter-------Ranged DPSMinstrel------HealerRune Keeper-DPS/Healer HybridLore Master--Dps/Healer/CC support HybridCaptain-------DPS/Support BufferPlayers can choose the races listed below.MANDWARFELVESHOBBITSThe game features group play at all levels by means of ""Fellowships"" that can be made between 2-6 players. Larger fellowships can be converted to Raid groups for 6-24 players. There are tons of instances all over middle earth that will take you anywhere from bree town to Helms  deep at the moment where players get to live their own Middle earth expiriences fighting the evils from mordor and isengard.A very easy to use crafting system is also in place for players who prefer to craft to benefit themselves or other players. There are many different crafting skills availab;e to tailor to a player's  specific tastes. This is a great MMO for people  who are newer to MMORPG's, or for the MMORPG veterans who simply want a taste of flavor. Everything in the user interfacce is easy to find and clearly explained throough tooltips if the player so desires them to be in and can be toggled off in the setting menu. A very easy to pickup, addicting game that you can pick up for free. Whats not to like? "
"Good game.  But dlc, expansions, content, etc. are relatively expensive if you don't want to grind for Turbine Points.Otherwise, it's a fairly good free to play model for a game that runs well on a potato, and looks good enough.Also, it has a roleplay community on Landroval and Laurelin if you're into that sort of thing.  Or if you aren't, just pretend they're immersive npcs."
"While I have not played this game in some years, it was a very important part of my childhood. I believe I first played this game when it went free to play, and I fell in love, even though the pay to play content was at times somewhat intrusive. I no longer have any particular desire to play, as I have grown out of any interest in MMOs, but if I were to play any of the games available in the style, LOTRO would absolutely be my first choice."
Explore Middle Earth and participate in the behind the scenes action and battles you don't get in the bookd or movies. Tolkien would be amazed to see what his creation has turned into today.
"Love this game.  Returned recently after leaving during Shadows of Angmar.  Thoroughly enjoying the game.  Beautiful landscapes, and well written stories.  Decent skill tree system, and leveling doesn't feel too fast.  "

"Product received for freeIf you love Tolkien's books, the Lord of the Rings film series, or even the Hobbits series, this game is a must! Highly recommended!The core of the game is free to fownload and play, and the rest must be paid for. But you can play for ages in just the core alone and still have a great time. The maps are huge, the detail and variety in environments, characters and graphics beautiful, the stories and quests fit in perfectly with Tolkien's world. Free players can play most of the character types and classes and characters can be customized to your whims during creation. You can play on the ""dark side"" too if you wish. Your choice of character class and type influences where you start playing, your choice of weapons, abilities, items, the initial storyline and quests etc., so experiment a bit. (There is a limit on free characters, but you can create characters on multiple servers.) Characters can be further customized with in-game clothing and items. Though Premium (paying) players have greater choice and can buy some items easily, free players can also have in-game housing, transport and storage and build up a huge collection of items, with just a bit of patience. I found other players to be helpful and friendly, you can play solo if you wish, but joining up with other players for support, quests, battles etc. is highly recommended. The chat system is well-developed but can be bewildering at first for new players. The range of quests and missions etc. is just as big and varied. There are so many ways to play this game, you can explore, collect, battle, craft and develop your character in any way you choose.Try it, it's great!"
"This game is interesting. One of the first MMOs I tried playing (I think Heroes of the Three Kingdoms predated my trying out LotRO), it was an... interesting experience at the time. The game has aged well enough. And the action is still there... in spurts. The biggest problem when I first started playing was that the lag would kill any movement around the time you arrived at Breeland. That seems to have been eased now (whether better computer, connection, or just more people farther on, I cannot say).Each of the classes are rich and detailed in their own right. And combat is fun.It also brings more lore to your attention, if your experience with the Lord of the Rings is more-or-less confined to the movies..."
"Great game all-round, the expasions are worth it if you feel the need for more gameplay. Nice game to play with your friends with great combat, beautiful graphics and a lengthy list of quests to complete. One problem I found is that if your game is a tad buggy for whatever reason. Do NOT verify the files with Steam, the client will redownload the game. If anything needs to be updated, Turbine will release it, not Steam. Steam is just the portal to LOTRO. Otherwise, it's a good game all round. Totally recommended, even if you haven't watched LOTR (I haven't). This game is still good (2016 update)"
"This was my first MMO RPG, and i'm glad to say I enjoyed it very much. Cool take on the Tolkien Universe, but beware the many Micro Transactions...there are alot, and many are tempting..."
"I started playing Lotro at launch and then stopped playing for many years. I have recently come back (after being inspired by the Hobbit movies!) and I'm really enjoying it.The free to play model is very generous here; there is an absolute ton of content to play for free including the entire epic quest which is really good. Plus just by playing normally you earn Turbine points which can be used to unlock niceties such as the ability to ride a horse and so on.It's a very content rich game, with great story amd there's also a lot of fun stuff to do with all the festival. The community is one of the nicest ones in the MMO space and if you are into RP then this is very well catered for on some of the RP servers."
"I love this game, why? You can play on your own tempo and there is alot to do in the world, even in the Free edition.The expansions are realy great but I should start with the free edition to see if you like the gameplay, ofcource like any other MMO RPG the higher your level the more features.  If you do like it, and I know you will, the LOTR or Hobit or J.R. Tolkiën fans will for sure just for the story line alone, although if you do not know anything about the story, you will learn it gamewise!Like it? Wanna play more and want full features of the game? Then start with buying the ""Steely Dawm Starter Pack"".And then it is up to you but I would go first fo the ""Triple Pack"" and after for the ""Helm's Deep"" Base or Premium edition. Both are identical except that tyhe premium edition offers better gear and more in-game Turbine points.I used to play WoW for a real long time, up to Catacalism, then I stopped for almost a year or so untill the latest expansion came out and I got 30 days free play. I played up to lev 85, which is the max cap, but what I dont like is that everything in WoW, or you must Raid alot and do alot of epic dungeons, cost to much and that raids or goups are not like they used o be.If you wanna Raid or run some Heroics then you should at least know what your role is and I hate people that think they know all and start bullying others and leave middle game.Find a Guild in LOTR and if you have a few friends that play, the fellowship playing style is just awsome!"
"Maybe im just getting too old and don't have the patience of old. Big fan of lotr, and mmos. Couldn't believe this game was free, i remember thinking ""wow how could i have missed this gem"" especially after reading the great reviews this game got. This game reminded me a bit of Warhammer Online which was an mmo i loved so much. The only reason this game has survived this long is because of lotr fans. There is a decent ""fanatic"" playerbase that won't let this game die and they need newbies to come along to feed and boost their ego. I dont mind that aspect, i was that player in Warhammer online. But what made me uninstall this game was the fact that you have to PAY to get ahead for everything... and i mean EVERYTHING. Every quest every notification you get is ""Go to the LOTRO store to unlock this"" or ""Go to the LOTRO store to make this faster"" its absurd how none of the reviews i read mentioned this. probably because i only focused on the good. I get how the devs need to make money but come on! at one point i thought ""well, im an adult with a job and its a free game... why not spend a little cash"" so i took a look at the lotro store and i was shocked! VIP for a year is like 200 dollars! if i want to buy a simple horse to get around 25 dollars! everything is so expensive and this game is sooooo old! i think the graphics on Zelda on the N64 looked 10x better! The quests consists of : talk to Sally Took, now talk to Barbara Took, now go back to Sally to tell her what Barbara said, now go back to Barbara to tell her of Sally's response.... And they're 10 minutes apart!!!  (without buying the 25 dollar horse) im sure this game will get better if i were to put more hours into it, but i can already tell i would have to spend a significant amount of money to compete, and to make it worthwhile. I like being rewarded for having no life and grind out levels/items... i don't like being rewarded for how much cash i have to spend."
"I present you the video passage of the game Lord of the Rings Online, more precisely, its main storyline, which is here proudly called ""epic"". Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters. Passage does not carry the main purpose of suggesting something to the players (although not without this, of course). Here, rather nostalgia, combined with the analysis of the plot and its connection with the original, untouched universe."
This is my first PC game and my first MMORPG. I'm a huge LOTR universe fan so I'm enjoying seeing all the places and things from the books. The people already playing the game have all been super friendly and helpful. No complaints so far.
"I strongly recommend this game for any classic MMORPG & LOTR fan.LOTRO has an immense amount of side story & lore vs. the traditional movies.Although this game is quite old now, the graphics are still considerably good.  DX11, DX10, DX9 settings allow backwards compatibility with older machines & laptops.  Choose to download HD textures, or not.  Choose to play at 1080p, or not.  It's your world for the taking!For a free to play game, you start off with everything you need.  A decent amount of character creation selection, a decent amount of storage space, access to all beginning area quests, as well as access to two more area quest packs.  Once you're in your LvL 20's is when you will need to purchase quest packs.To purchase quest packs, you have four choices:1) Go VIP & get access to them as part of VIP.2) Purchase packs from the LOTRO store/Steam directly.2) Use real money to buy in-game premium currency to purchase them.3) Create a grind character to grind TP (Turbine Points) to purchase them.You will earn in-game premium currency (Turbine Points) just by playing the game.  Completion of certain quests, or deeds, will grant a set amount.  Deeds are ""passive"" quests.  Example, kill 100 wolves would be a deed.  Use a certain skill a certain number of times is a deed.  I was able to grind 150TP in just over 1 1/2hrs.  One hint, it involves creating a second character, Elvish, and doing certain quests & deeds.If you're a crafter, this game has a very in-depth crafting system.  It is also simple to wrap your head around.  An added bonus, certain crafted items allow you to name them.  Every item you craft, the characters name who crafted it will be in the item description.If you just like a quick jump into battle then log off, there is a feature called Skirmish.  This is a closed mission/dungeon where you can take other players with you, or go it solo.  Either way, you can just hack n slash.  Skirmishes are unlocked around lvl20.  Although you don't get drops off of the foes, you do earn Skirmish Marks.  These are spent in Skirmish Camps.  You can purchase armor, weapons, rare crafting materials, cosmetic attire, etc.Here is a video, from 4 months ago, that I recorded when doing a solo Skirmish:http://youtu.be/e7utB69IXLsIf you like to play in a group with other people, there are two types.1) A Fellowship.2) A KinshipA fellowship is your standard everyday party/group.  You're just out to do a quick quest.  A standard fellowship has a maximum of 6.  A raid fellowship has 12.Raids can be extremely difficult, or, extremely easy.  You will find, as usual, most PUGs (pick-up groups), will fail unless they have a much higher level player, or a very experienced veteran player, leading the way.  Raids are also only ever done at end-game.  Unless you're in a kinship.  Many hours can be wasted during a raid with nothing in return other than a very costly repair bill.A kinship is your standard everyday guild/clan.  These are the groups of people you prefer to do raids, quests, events, etc. with.  Kinships also gain levels based on time.  A kinship can reach a max level of 10, with a max number of members at 1,000.  Every character you create can be in a different kinship.  A kinship can also have a Kinship Home.  Similar to a guild hall.  This comes at a fairly steep cost at lower levels.  A kinship is only allowed 1 home.  The kinship leader decides on access rules, though all kinship members generally have full access.Every LOTRO account is allowed to have 1 home for their characters.  You can purchase, & find treasure, cosmetic gear to spruce up your place & make it look just how you want it.  You can also purchase additional storage chests to keep extra special items.All in all, this game is FREE!  Download it & try it!If you like casual, but still exciting, playing at your own pace, or even just only crafting and never doing anything else, this game is for you!P.S.Although it says I've played less than 100 hours, I never really had a need to use Steam.  I only ever played LOTRO & nothing else.  Played it straight for nearly 4 years & also Beta tested it.  I've seen this game change so many numerous times, but I still hear it's call in my dreams...trying to drag me back...back to a neverending world of lore."
This is an amazing game which has survived for a long time. It gets hate for not having a ton of players but that still doesn't stop me and many others from getting the time to play and enjoy. I have played this game for 7+ years (The hours in steam are nothing compared to what I actually have played) but yea it has hooked me for this long and will continue to hook me. If you are looking into starting add me and I can help we can even play together sometime
"The greatest )MMO'RPG I have ever played. It holds true to Tolkien´s story and the developers have added even more!It´s possible to encounter Frodo in his hobbit hole, but also to let Saruman fling you off his tower, need I say more?!Play this game if you love LOTR!"
"This game is my first mmorpg ever and i got to say being new to the genre is confusing but LOTRO makes it simple. The community is the best ive ever seen in any game, Im only level 8 and a level 84 came up to me and showed me the ropes and basics of buying housess and getting a horse and stuff like that. I was very suprised when he pulled out a lute and starting playing Skyrim music, I asked him how he did it and didnt say. all in all I have much to do and explore and with only 12 hours in (currently) I belive theres is much more fun to be had, so far 8/10 mainly because im still confused about alot of things but thats just me, ITS WORTH GETTING"
"I stummped up at the beginning and am a founder member.. Ive played from the begining.. I totallt understand the grype of pay to win, but I paid only once and now the game is free to me as I get monthly coinbonus which over the years buys the expansions.   Graphically it requires an update but overall it is what it is..even if you only go as far as lvl50 theres 100s of hours of free play.   I nevere pay to win..I dont have the best kit ... my best character is 1 level from cap.. for me its the expansive quality and quest lore completion, Ive not even gone into Mordor yet.As for the worlds, all that I can tell you is that Laurelin is pretty active server, and grouping for dungeons is not a huge hastel..if thats what you want to do.Yes there are power lvlers..but for those who completed SKYRYM etc in 8 weeks then phhhh"
"The world in LOTRO truly feel like a world. It has beautiful scenery and feels vast and coherent. It is tantalizing to explore areas, places, towns and villages you have read in the books, and seen in the films. Once in a while you encounter the famous characters from the stories of Lord of the Rings which is ongoing behind the scenes. For a lore player this is a dream since there is always so much to delve deeper into if you wish.The only downside to the feel of the game are the player characters. They have an outdated or even unnatural feel to them, which is contrary to the rest of the world (which has a fantastic natural feel).The epic quest line is a joy, and I recommend that you take your time and follow the actually story in those quests."
"Playing Lord of the rings online brings you back to middle earth, The game is known for it's awsome landscape and texture's. Everyone should play this game if you love mmorpg and if u love the Lord of the Ring movies or books."
"Okay before I have anyone hating on this review, I know it's an big bloody pay to win but that doesn't really matter because it's more PvE then PvP.Like if u were dedicated and had the money to upgrade state points u would probably be able to beat an lv 100, which would be hilarious.Now let's get to the point, this game is anaddictive as f*** MMORPG and I'm right about that, iv been playing for 4 days and already hit 27 hours. This game hasn't aged at all it still looks pretty for those hard core graphic fans and is still being updated to this very day. It has an pretty basic combat system but very hard to master the skills and which skills to use first and etc, just because of the skills I dont even use my mouse, I have to put both of my hands on the keyboard.The game hasn't died yet and I think its not going too with people still starting this game, most servers are pretty active and most of the community is mature but the only stupid things I saw on world chat is dont say sh** or f*** ye my kids play this. Like I can barely understand how to play this game and how are kids going to play this, but there are kids who lose their child hood pretty quick. Don't worry about in game money which is turbine u earn most of it by just playing the game and skaying everything. Crafting is key in this game and you'll need a couple of friends to craft what u need or multiple toons because crafting is the only why u get good sh**. It's full of quest and so much dialogue but not much talking maybe some lines ,because if u thing about it it would cost a fortune to get so many voice actors. But don't worry the cut scenes for story have sexy voice acting;). Also trust me when it says massive u'll be running ur♥♥♥♥♥up and down but it is all worth it in the long run. This is my first MMORPG that had a very good first impression  so I'll give it an 9/10 because they didn't f*** it up yet.Why are u stilI reading its free go ahead and already get it."
"~This is going to be a rather long review, please take a couple minutes and read through it if you're considering playing Lord of the Rings Online. :3Many people have said that this game is 'dying' and that has either scared people away from even starting to play, or pushing away old players who wish to play again. ~I am here to say that this game is NOT dying, NOT on it's last leg, or anything of the sort! The only reason that people from Steam say that is because Steam only shows people who are playing Lotro through Steam, but this amazing game was available, still is available to download through their website. This game has a flourishing community, many helpful people that would happily start playing with you, but only if YOU give this game a chance.In this next section, I will review what I think are the Pro's and Con's of this game. Pro's:~Many friendly people who absolutely love to play together, just waiting for you.~Flourishing community to answer all your questions and comments.~Fun and engaging content to keep you hooked for hours.~Simple crafting to gear your leveling character.~Many different classes to choose from to fit your playstyle.~Dungeons just waiting for you and your friends to plunder them.~The best gear in the game is crafted by players, not bought from a cash shop.Con's:~Many servers have a decline in population. (To move to Brandywine.)~Over-Simplified crafting.~Lag spikes in highly populated area's (As expected.)~Longer-than-usual server downtimes for simple repairs and maintenence.~Many things are still bought from the cash shop. (Personal Con.)~No real end-game (Yet, but plenty of gearing and skill tweaking to do.)You may notice that I have crafting in both Pro's and Con's, mainly because in the last massive update they (Turbine) made crafting super easy, but still fun for the leveling character.If you have read the review and agree, or disagree with what I have said about this magnificent game, go ahead and send a friend request and we can talk it over. ~If you're a new player, or a returning player who found my review helpful, you can find me on the Brandywine server, or even better, just send a friend request here. :D Always happy to help and chat. :3 "
"Until today this was the best MMORPG i have played, impossible to get bored playing this game, the Middle Earth provides many incredible adventures. It's a full plate for those who like Tolkien's literature!!! ^^"
"A friend of mine recently introduced me to Lord of the Rings (I had never seen it) which led to me getting this game. I have to say that I really enjoy it! I like the combat system because it's not overly complicated and many of the concepts within the game are easy to grasp, even to someone who is fairly new to the LOTR universe. I do sometimes struggle with things like the map, meaning I have a hard time going the right way. However, I believe that this is due to my being new at the game and I feel that I will get the hang of it as I continue to play this amazing game!"
i like this game but its a huge pay to win and small thing devs fix the damn map it is absolute garbage you cant find♥♥♥♥♥♥with it that being people or the way to get to other towns. fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥but as a whole its pretty fun and i wish it wasnt as much pay to win because its pretty bad on that.
I can't believe I haven't found this game until now.  I am a huge LOTR fan and ive been playing MMO's since everquest.  I gotta say this is a well polished game with great lore and a good community.  The Dev's have made this game make sense.  The customer service is good I had a in-game problem and within 5 mins of submitting a ticket I had my issue resolved.  You have to pay a little money to unlock some things but its well worth.  10/10!
Lord of the Rings Online is the only way you have to experience the world of Middle-Earth and it does a great job at it. You walk alongside key figures of the story while making your own. The story alone is enough to keep you. Everything else is bonus.
"This game is wizardry! Literaly! The games graphics in 2014 look dated at best however I find them charming and entertaining. The game has one awesome comabt system, its not standstill but it is (look at gameplay) its combat is huge! So many moves and choices its insane! The game is fun as ever with updates, the game has yet to crash so i'd say its descently stable. The game consists of idiotic quests like fetch quests how ever there still are some awesome quests out there, I enjoy the game to say least. The game has slightly become a pay to win type model which I am against however it is interesting just over overpriced things are unless you shell out cash and buy it. Nonetheless love the game, crap pcs should run it on high or ultra I will reccomend this game to people who aren't graphic nuts. If you get the game your in for one adventure"
"TL;DR version: A solid game, very entertaining for slow and casual playing where you enjoy the leveling and don't even bother to think about ""the end-game"". Consider this Skyrim, except it's Tolkien, and you might occasionally run into other people.RP ( on Laurelin ) is good if you find the right people and places.PVP ( or Monster Play ) can vary on servers but mostly it's rather dead. Don't expect PVP to be at all balanced as it has almost no focus in the game.End-game: There are raids and bosses but as I said, don't bother thinking about them. Just focus on enjoying the leveling progress - it won't be fast, and the end-game isn't grand enough to be worth rushing your way there.Rambly version:First the most important thing: you should really consider this more of a Free to Try game, rather than Free to Play.  It's true that you earn Turbine Points ( = money )  within the game ( quite a lot too, and easily if you don't mind grinding ) but subscribing is still vastly better if you actually want to play the game without significant limitations ( all of which you can remove with Turbine Points though ). Honestly, you shouldn't think of this as a huge drawback - F2P ( P2W ) games are still a rather new thing and the common model for MMOs has for a long time been to require a subscription. LoTRO wasn't initially free either.That aside, I wouldn't recommend this game to the usual ADHD MMO button smasher kiddie ( for one thing the combat system is queued ). While it has been eased up from what it was, there is still significant grinding involved in the game. Pure, ""Kill 300 Wolves for X"" grinds, straight up. These are called Deeds and you earn stat boosts ( and Turbine Points, titles and other things ) by completing them, but for the gameplay purposes, the stat boosts ( Traits ) are most important. However, if you are the type of person who just loves to put on some music, audiobook or even just watch TV while sloooowly advancing your character, this game will be awesome for you.Gameplay is alright, but I admit it's not the greatest out there. Movement is pretty fluid, though some of the animations are a bit stiff. Skills and such don't feel very streamlined ( I feel there's a lot of redundancy - skills are there just so that you have many buttons to press ) and the combat queue is a bit clumsy. It's unique, I give it that but on certain classes I've found it very annoying. Still, it is as planned and the combat is relatively slow as a result. There are also some minor UI annoyances here and there that take getting used to ( stack splitting, cannot vendor items straight from inventory - need to use vendor ui, have to drag and drop a lot ). On the plus side, you can rearrange your UI exactly as you please and also get some nifty 3rd party skins if you're into that ( there are few other plugins as well ).The graphics are a bit dated but unless you're used to always only playing newest and shiniest games, it shouldn't bother you overly much. However the overall atmosphere with the music and scenery is amazing, especially if you are a Tolkien fan. Even if you aren't in to RP, I expect one would appreciate the first time they see the valley of Rivendell open up to them, or watching the sunrise in the Shire, not to mention many of the other iconic places mentioned in the books, or seen in the movies.This is a very fun game for those who enjoy Tolkien's world, casual but very grindy PVE, casual to no PVP and any amount of RP. For social people, the community is generally friendly and you shouldn't have trouble finding a Kin ( guild ) that suits your tastes. For lone-wolves, there is plenty of solo content and for the most part you don't really need a group either."
"A great MMORPG. You can explore every inch of Middle-earth, except for closed regions. They are added with expansion packs over time. If you are a Middle-earth fan, LOTRO should be your favorite."
" Before the Rider's of Rohan expansion, especially around the time of Mines of Moria expansion, this was easily the best MMO on the market. This was a fantastic game with great visuals, story, and the best community in any online game I've ever associated myself with, but it has been turned awry, presumably by the heads at Warner Bro's Interactive. The levelling experience from 1-75 should be as fun as ever, but thanks to horribly uneccesary class changes, among other things, the experience is desecrated. Thankfully, newcomers should still be able to get some enjoyment out of this marred product, though returning veterans will undoubtedly be dissapointed. (seriously the Helm's Deep battles are awful, and the mounted combat is even worse) "
I recommend this game for any Lord of the Rings fan that wants to go to all the places in middle earth they read about. As far as an MMO goes it is average but for me personally the setting made this game come alive. I loved being in middle earth and had a lot of fun.
"A seriously good MMORPG, I suggest everyone should give it a try! And don't you even dare to quit before reaching level 25 and say ""It's sh*t!"", coz you can not say anything bad unless you have tried it first, applies to every game. EDIT: Still lovin' it."
"I log in to make sure our kinship house upkeep is paid. I raised fishing to max. I have logged more hours into this game than any other game. I raised fishing to max. I caught up to 5 50-lb salmon. I raised fishing to max. I like the lore, main story line of the game, and the quests. I raised fishing to max. WoW is the better game all around, but I think LOTRO shines with the subject of the game and how they handle the questing. I raised fishing to max. LOTRO is outdated, but I am glad to see it is still up and running. I raised fishing to max. The last comment I have; The community is outstanding. People are nice and helpful. When you are grouping with people, they genuinely try to work together. I haven't had a bad experience with any player. I raised fishing to max."
"So, this game, when I played it, had one of the greatest player communities I've ever seen. It was absolutely amazing how immersed you felt. Graphics don't matter when you have people who love a game that much.It has been a long time since I've come back to this game, I'm hoping not much has changed, I remember playing it before it was Free to Play, and I was beyond impressed, the more I see other people play other MMO games, or multiplayer games, the more I miss growing my pipe weed, sitting in a tavern, or listening to a player band play their hearts out. I miss exploring the beautiful world that is Middle Earth, and I miss my Dwarven Champion.Not just did this game have an amazing player base, but it also had THE BEST questing I've ever experienced in ANY other mmo game, and in some cases in many other RPG games. I would go so far as to say Lotro defeats The Witcher (Series) and Kotor (1-2), two series I love very much. I remember there was an amazing depth to the game, where, sure you were one player among many, but every adventure felt important, not just your journey to become the strongest, but more your perilous trek to explore this vast world. I am a returning player, and all I can say, is I hope not much has changed, this game was almost perfect, I hope it still is."
"I have sunk months, even years of my time in this game.At times, it's made me cringe, at others, it's made me smile. It's got this great sense of you doing something meaningful cause it's not all blown up into you being the one person who'll save Middle-Earth (cause let's just be clear, the original storyline is still vaguely in the game, you occasionally meet members of the fellowship)But 2 things really bother me in this game : although it stands proud despite the test of time, the graphics and dialog system show it isn't as modern as it used to be. (On dialog : whenever you talk to someone, a huge window appears, and your only options are accept or decline. Often even only accept or close the window)One other thing : the ""cool stuff is for higher levels"" mentality. I have a terrible problem where I rerun the early levels content 250 times because my character doesn't turn out exactly the way I want it to, and that mentality makes those early levels kinda boring. Once you get there, it's really worth it though.Last thing : the social pannel for searching a party needs some reworks/hype cause I usually end up having played for over 5 hours while searching for others to do a skirmish with (which is a small instance) and no having found anyone.Besides all of that, I absolutely love this game, it's my all-time favorite."
Product received for freeGreat Game. It take a long time to get far though.The only thing I dont like about it is you have to buy things to get past some hard enemys and places.But its a really fun Game!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD GAME. ITS DEAD AND NEVER WAS ALIVE. NO ONE PLAYS IT. COMBAT IS BORING NOT REWARDING AND IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE FORCING IT APON YOURSELF. IF YOU IGNORE THIS RECOMENDATION YOU WILL THEN BE UTTELY DESTROYED AND IF YOU LIKE THE GAME THEN YOUR POOR!
"Upon entering Rhovanion we were set upon by a new type of enemy. This enemy would forever change my perception of this game, as I stood there, awestruck by the brilliant mechanic before me I could not help but to contemplate the big questions. How was this not caught in testing? Worse yet, if it was caught in testing, who thought it was a good idea to let it through?  As my initial shock vanished, I came to the conclusion that something of unfathomable importance had just happened on this Tuesday morning in the Norcrofts. I must admit I had my doubts as to what was happening after having first acquired my Glider in the Wold, but this.. no this was something different entirely. In all of this I could not help but think to myself that ""This may have looked dumb, but in all honesty these graphics somehow still holds up fairly well."" This thought was destined to continue for some time but as I spotted some gathering nodes I swiftly went into a state of blinded greed where I threw all safety and precaution to the wind as I dashed over to mine it. Sadly, I was still in combat.At this moment I realised that the mighty fine enemy who previously had left me awestruck still remained in existance. Unfortunately it was nowhere to be seen. I decided to cut my losses and move forward with my quests. Close to ten minutes passed as I was flailing away at seemingly unendless quests including the slaughter of what I now presume to be a close to extinct race of Goblins (Seriously, if you don't like beating up Goblins, this game is not for you, theres millions of them and you WILL have to kill every. Single. One. Twice.), I was monitoring my minimap as usual. An old habbit from my days of playing Delta Force 2. Granted, there was no radar in Delta force 2, but still the point stands. I should say that there was a minimap in Delta Force 2, but this one only displayed the topography of the landscape and did  in no way alert you to the potential hazards of an enemy that had attacked you over ten minutes ago charging back at you from nowhere. This minimap however, does precisely that. I watched a red little marker on the minimap come charging at me at inhumane speed. Inhumane for two reasons. Primarily because it was not human. But the fact that this tiny goblin was also mounted seemed to also contribute to this partcular notion. The lil' guy attacked me. Once. Before charging off into the distance once more. At this point I could but embrace one simple fact: I will never get out of combat, that superbly speedy and obnoxiously sneaky Goblin will keep me in combat until one of us perish. Being stubborn, rather than lazy, I opted to simply track down the bugger. This, I might add, is where my true adventure began. For the next thirty minutes, I would walk back and forth in the middle of Norcroft (For those of you who have never seen Norcrofts, its just a huge plains.), Every once in a while my good friend the mounted Goblin, whom I after the third time attacking me had been baptized George, would attack me to keep me in combat. All while dashing off into a different direction than which I was traveling towards before in an feeble attempt to catch him. Fed up with this little concept of a mounted enemy who apparently does not know how to stop, I opted for running to the edge of the map and await Georges return next to one of the many mountains that encircle the plains. As George had a tendency of walking by roughly every ten minutes I decided to go grab myself a drink. Not that it is relevant for the review, but I should probably inform you that it was a cup of Tea, Lemon green tea. Highly recommended.Upon returning I was, to my dismay, at about 3% hp with a Norcroft Field-bear happily chipping away at my health. However this was not all! Looking at my minimap I fondly observed how George was, indeed, nearby. The poor little fellow had got himself lodged into the mountainrange on the side of the map and tried incredibly hard to get himself dislodged. This process, apparently, took around ten minutes, then he would charge off and slap someone, most recently: me, in the face before dashing off and getting himself stuck on the other side of the map. It was with resounding joy I found myself dying to that Field-bear and watching Dear old George finally reset and return to his appropriate location in the fields where he belongs and will graze away peacefully until he runs into another player who will undoubtedly rejoice in the idea of never having to leave combat ever again.Unfortunately however, the gliding characteristics of the mounts in Rhovannion prohibits me from ever moving past the area due to sheer amusement, but other than that..10/10!"
"Excellent graphics, scenery, cosmetics. Unbeatable storyline (LOTR). Endless content to keep you busy, from easy solo missions to big dragon raids, and Isengard dungeons. See places from the main story, or places you rarely ever hear of. Currently this game stretches from The Shire, thru Moria and the Misty Mountains, all the way to Isengard and beyond! Very polished and easy to play. Totally worth giving this one a try if your a LOTR fan. 9/10Review about starter packs:This game is truely amazing. I've played it for years. The only problem with this specific pack is that it doesn't even provide you with VIP status for 30 days. That is extra on top of this initial cost. I would only recommend this starter pack to people who really like to collect in their MMOs. Otherwise, just play for free until your ready for VIP."
"Lord of the Rings Online is quite simply a WoW-Port with a few unique features that make it an interesting alternative, if not an objectively superior game. One such feature is that in Azeroth, you can't kill foes with Music.  In Middle Earth, Lutes are lethal."
"First...What is a video game ?Why do I play a video game ?A Game is basically an entertaining activity, some are more stimulating than others, and some stimulate reactions over concentration. If you get this logic right; you can discover a whole world of possibilities through video games. Someone could just decide to create a ""goat Simulator"" for fun (and you would pretend to be a goat), or create a Massive Multiplayer Game where everybody interacts with each other to accomplish goals in the game.There is a myriad of games out there today and some will tickle you to play, based on your interests of course.About Lord of the Rings Online :1st. Interests:Yes I am interested in the Lord of the Rings lore. I like the Medieval style, the powerful evil, the hobbits, the elves, the faith, the glory, the flowers, name it. I read the complete story years ago, way before the movies. Am I a complete sold out and corrupt Lord of the rings fan ?  Nope, not at all. I just like the writing style and the human-side, possibly believable logic-reality-fantasy, story of it all.2nd. The Genre:MMO. I am not a MMO FAN, in fact, I hate MMO's. They are a repeatable-similar-cut-and-paste infinite same thing said differently, lather repeat. This type of game is kinda of free-roaming-reading do the same thing. The story is vaguely known, the sense of it is tasteless.  Just roam, talk to someone and pretend it is fun. Now that's my point. (Lord of the GATHErings I called it back in my debut)3rd. Entertainment: Is Lotro entertaining? Well... I must say that something was entertaining, and still is... after playing this type of game for so long now... and still playing it ! What happened to my anti-MMO player side ?  It got impressed !!The cutscenes were a nice feature that propels you directly into the current conflict (linked to the departure of the fellowship...and following right down in their footsteps is totally great. The feeling of being part of the LOTRO world was achieved greatly with all those characters and storyline. The sense of my character being known to this fake-world was cool.  There is also an outrageous number of QUESTS ! From main quests, side quests, skill quests, deeds quests, trait quests to crafting quests, I am probably forgeting some.. there is so much.Yes, the graphics are now outdated even with full DirectX11. But it doesn’t get you out of the story that much. If you like the Lore, you will probably find it cartoony acceptable.What was the most entertaining to me, was the fact that I can take out the time I want in the LOTRO world to do whatever I wish. Roleplay with some stangers, do quests, craft, manage my house and garden decorations, look up the price of some useless item that some people desire. (Of course, in other MMO's you can also lose your time the way you want) But the most appreciable assets in those moments; The sounds ! Everytime I hooked up my headphones.. I was submerged in the wild environment, the ambiance and the tension felt everywhere in the wilderness.LOTRO convinced me where no other MMO could. The sound ! Especially in Moria... this is where it all began down the hill for me... I became a LOTRO FAN :) in Moria.Before that, It was Lord of the Gatherings ! I hopped in from time to time with a friend or two... running beside them and trying to follow up their leveling. Which was a pain ! Since they were so much into it and were leveling Fast in VIP mode.OK Now we get to VIP and the Free to Play thing.YES, before... believe it or not. IT was not FREE. You had to pay the game, and subscribe for the experience. I was not playing at that time.It then became f2p. Which is a matter of attracting new players to try the game and hopefully, make them pay to achieve their pleasure.It is FREE totally up to lvl 20... then you get the point, that if you want to continue and level up... or have some fun in this world, you will have to grind a lot of time to achieve some goals and earn some turbine points (In game store currency) to buy some useful needed quests pack or stuff. Yup, it’s a business world, where programmers need to eat, and infrastructure guys needs funds to host the game on Technical Horsepower, If you want a free computer, free energy, free internet, free games... well... Then you better get out and change this world to accept FREE as a currency. In the meantime, you won’t have any time left to play your favorite game, you will probably be outside growing your food and waiting the harvest to exchange some for... lets say... a computer! :)Is this game entertaining? YES, to me it is! And it is well worth some money. I bought some Turbine points with real money when there was a double bonus points event... and then waited for the 30-50% rebate on quests pack that comes along once or twice a year... It was well worth the ride. (More than VIP)4th factor: Replayability:Yes you can replay over and over again. Let’s say with another character.  There is so much quests... that you can probably live a lot of adventures in a completely different manner.The rest will be similar, in traits, deeds, skills and all with a slight new flavor. It's the same Game.5th factor. Price over time spent:If you pay 60$ per year for the new call of duty and you only play the campaign like me... well it is a shame. The game is much more satisfying online versus people. You can frag for a full year ! 60$ for 300 hours of game play.But for me... Since 3d Shooters is not my Main Genre, I play the campaign for 15 hours, do some LAN party with friends... and then put it on the shelf. 60$ for 40 hours ! Not the most satisfying purchase.In LOTRO, I spent about 70$ and got... if one level is 3-4 hours roughly...  320 hours since 2010 and I am not done at all with my purchases !  (Played with independent Client)It is well worth the run.If you are a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, you will probably like it even more. Besides that, it is well balanced in simplicity and complexity and its pace follows comfortably your period of learning the game.It's a MMO, you may be charmed by the genre or you may hate it. But from an adventurous point of view, even with my hate of MMO, I still have fun in this game.Conclusion, LOTRO is good, and for myself, my adventures continue mainly because of the subject world; Lord of the Rings, and its outstanding engineering sounds that keeps me coming back into the woods."
"The developers of the game screwed it up so bad that they are litterally just rushing new content as fast as they can to move on to another game. Before they overhauled the entire class system it was an amazing game, after.... not so much."
"I'm a huge Fan of The Lord of the Rings Books and The Movies,  so why not make it the First game I download and play on Steam, it completes the circle, no Pun intended. I'm new to the whole PC gaming style and keyboard gameplay, but what i've seen so far, this game is very Cool, graphics and Word play are very on point, i advise you to use a powerful computer and a good graphics card to fully experience the gameplay and to see the World on which you journey threw. The Story line is very much the same with the books and movies. with a few side missions that adds a little more spice to your gameplay. Would i recommend the this Game, Yes i would, i'm true game player, that spans from everygame console, and Pc games (which i used a remote control), so i fully appreciate the time and effort WB GAMING put into this game, the ADD-ONs are spot on, SO the game is free, but of course to get your hands on the Add-On's , you must shell out some cash, no Biggie!  So get your hands on this game, if you haven't already. That is all..."
"Fun game, however there is one big problem. This game is pretty fun and has some nice content, however even though it is advertised as a Free to play or (F2P), it is EXTREMELY limited until you spend money.  This game is fun and it is 100% "" possible"" to play without spending money. LOTRO is much more fun if you subscribe atleast once as it unlocks an enormous amount of things that would otherwise be a severe handicapAll things considered, I would only recommend getting this game if you are prepared to drop 15 dollars on it for a 1-month subscription to unlock everything."
"PROS.I can literally shout my enemies to death. People are friendly. Within my first 5 hours a team of Russians recruited me for their kinship and have showered me with help.  I can't understand a single thing they say without Google Translate but they don't seem to care.Completing quests is addictive for someone with a completionist, list-loving personality like me.CONS.If you don't want to shell out real money for this free-to-play game, you will have to run everywhere at the speed of Slow until you have saved enough Turbine Points to buy a damn horse.I haven't seen a whole lot of actual RP taking place so far. Tested my theory by dramatically fainting in front of a large group of people.  Everyone promptly ran away.  Can't say I blame them."
"I've been playing this game on and off since release, I still have the original physical copy even though that is now pretty useless. I've really struggled making headway. I play for a while, stop, comeback moths or even years later and start again. The one thing I have to say about this game is props to the devs. I know Turbine got a lot of criticism for going F2P and perhaps rightly so, but to still be releasing content after nearly 10 years is incredible in a time where if games aren't commercially successful instantly they are dead within a year. I really hope they continue until endgame in Mordor."
"I used to love this game. In fact, it was my favorite MMO. I loved the Legendary Items, loved the raids, loved the PVP, loved the crafting, and most importantly, loved the world and story. At some point along the way, Turbine suffered a few hits to their staff. Many developers were gone as a result. This was awful for the game. For some reason, they decided to take away group content and focus on ""Big Battles"" which some would argue that it is still group content, but it is extremely lacking. I have played this game since Shadows of Angmar beta and loved it, but without the group content and developers being let go, I have a feeling this game is dying. I hope that isn't the case. Do I recommend the game? Well, it depends. I loved what it was and hate what it's becoming. Hopefully it will get better as time goes on. Time will tell."
This is a great game for rpg fans and lord of the rings fans. Have fun with your friends while making new ones along the way as you adventure deep into middle earth on your quests. Play as a free person of middle earth fighting the ever growing darkness or join the ranks of the monsters of middle earth.
"This is a truly amazing game for Tolkien fans and RPG gamers alike. The game give you access to many starting areas including the beloved Shire and Bree-lands as seen in the movies and books. And give you the opportunity to play completely f2p by earning Turbine points in game to unlock other areas in Middle Earth. Additionally the Epic (main) questline is completely f2p and you can run through the entire game at no cost, completely worth it. If you want to see the beoved characters true to the books, experience some authentic tolkien lore, play classes with incredible skills and characteristics, become a member of the highest crafting guilds and test your skills in fellowships with people from all over the world I completely reccomend this game :D"
"Great game if you are into slow paced games. With its beautiful sceneries and amazing music, you get this lotr feeling when you play it. Recommended if you are willing to spend money after you have advanced a little in the game (you have seen nothing when you have reached level 20, so much left to do!)cons:Very demanding in terms of in-game avaiability, you have to purchase off restrictions, like gold cap.You can't proceed further than level 30 if you are not interested in grinding repeated in-game activites.Not much player activity in old game areas, whereas at the level cap there is tons of player activity(depending on which server)pros: Beautiful and large sceneries, you can travel from thorin's hall to east-Rohan!You have to dedicate your time if you want to reach the best of the best, making it kind of adictive.Many recreations from Tolkiens books!Possible to earn enough in-game currency to unlock anything you want which would cost money, if you have time.8/10"
"Although this game seems outdated and there are a few problems with it, I love it.Some of the strong points of the game include:  Story and lore - there is a ton of story and lore packed into this game, which is awesome if you're a Tolkien fan  Music - the music is top-notch for the most part and really fits the world well  PvE content - there is always something to do, whether it's following a quest chain to level up you or your epic weapon, following the main storyline, fighting in a skirmish, decortaing your personal or kin house, or participating in one of the many festivals  Character housing - something WoW has yet to implement...Some of the weak points of the game are:  Rewards - Turbine has a problem with giving away proper rewards in their games. It happens in their D&D game as well. you can run through a long Instance for 20 minutes and get a bit of skirmish marks, or you can do a quick skirmish and get the same number of skirmish marks. And the daily gifts are usually something you don't need or want  PvP is lacking - I'm not very much into PvP, but if you are, this probably isn't the game for you. The PvP (in LoTRO, PvMP) system seems stale and boring. It is cool to be able to fight on the monster side, though  Graphics are outdated - models and animations need to be updated, though there are many times the graphics are quite beautiful. I appreciate that the graphics are less cartoony than other MMO's, but an update would help a lotMany people complain about it now being F2P, but it doesn't bother me, I just love the LoTR world and love being part of it. This game may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I definitely recommend it for a shade of Earl Grey."
"I know It says I have not played this for many hours, but I have over 2 thousand off of steam. It is not pay to win you can get to the level cap without paying. The best weapons in the game are crafted, not bought. It also has fantastic graphics for the low system requirments it has. The story is great. After the helms deep exansion it took away the traditional trait system of the game and made a few classes more powerful than they should. All in all this game is great and because it is free so there is no penalty for trying. The community is very open to newcommers even if most of the people have been playing for ever like me (Since 2007 open beta). I would ighly recomend this game to anyone who like traditional MMORPG games."
"To start off, I started playing this game since 2007, release, and played it ever since. So its kinda a game what always has been there to play and stayed fun! It has a great communitie and ingame feeling of the lord of the rings, (online) just sitting there behind your desk!Walking in the Misty Mountains/Moria and trough the lovely places of Rivendell and Lothlorien.and that just sightseeing! Incombat game is also just great, first they introduce you to the combat system and later-on you get to try out your role in skirmishes/great instances and so on. you could be a healer or a tank or even do damage!PvMP is also included.overal GREAT GAME!Brendan Duffy"
"Great game. Can get pricey, especially if you want to explore all the different regions, but seeing all the things you read about in the books is so fun! They really did a good job with the regions and the npcs. Graphics are great, cosmetic outfits are great, the different classes you can chose for your character and great. There are so many different facets of the game you are always learning something new. You will love it if you're a fan of Tolkien! You'll get to find Gollum's cave, talk to all your favorite characters (including Gwaihir), and visit beautiful places in Middle Earth!"
"By far one of my favorite games!! I haven't been able to sit and play a game as long as I have LOTRO and still enjoy it.Some might say it's a ""pay to play"" game but it's not if you know what you're doing.STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND START DOWNLOADING, NOW!!!"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about Lord of the Rings Online. Released in 2007, this game has captured my attention since it was first launched with the title Shadows of Angmar. One of the last true RPGs found within the MMO genre, the game captivates with its art and design that still manages to impress nearly a decade later. Despite drawbacks in population, ownership change at Turbine (purchased by Warner Bros in 2010), and the launch of A Free-2-Play model shortly after, LOTRO still has a magical draw about it that compels players to take up arms against the Dark Lord and trek across Middle-Earth. The game is worth the subscription cost, especially if purchased for 3 or more months in advance. If unable to afford the fee, there is a Free option with limitations; just about all of which can be unlocked in-game through the use of Turbine Points gained from completing various Deeds, both kill, quest and reputation. In general, the community is helpful- much of the time willing to assist a newcomer with answers to their many questions. Give the game a try, it is perfect for the hardcore quester, casual gamer, role-player and explorer; something for just about everyone."
"If You like games with huge, beautiful world to explore, story and quests you realy like to read, role-playing and cooperation with great community - Lord of the Rings Online is a perfect MMO for You. It is my 6th year with this game and I am still in love :)"
 A very good MMORPG . You have a bit of everything ( nice storyline as well as PVP possibility/ farm/ raid) I highly recommend this game to everyone interested in Tolkien's story and those who're searching for a friendly community. :)
"For a Lord of the rings fan, this game will be a true deligth for you. For the gamer community the game can be sometimes old fashioned, but you have to remember that this is and old game and can still compete with some mmorpg's out there.The storyline is awesome since its Tolkiens story, the character creation is pretty good, and combat sistem is ok.Overall i enjoy the gamea lot, there are things that could make the game one of the best out there but the dev's dont do these changes probably because it would take massive work and a lot of money to spend. (Like add a storyline for mordor forces and be able to figth for mordor from lvl 1 to lvl cap) that would be awesome and would bring a true pvp experience into the game that i think its one of the key things that this game misses.Anyways the game its awesome, the graphics dont seem outdated at all and you can really have a great time in this game. And if you play this with friends with the same level the experience gets even better. My recommendation is, if you want to try this game don't hesitate since its free to play and if you dont like it you can just uninstall ;)"
"TL;DROverall score of 6/10. Read below to find out why.F2P ModelI've never really been a fan of F2P games. Most F2P MMOs tend to overdo or implement micro-transactions counter-intuitively or completely wrong (Rift being one of those exceptions). So I figured I'd give LOTRO a try and see how they did. They failed. They are one of those examples of OVERDOING it. I realize companies' need to make money.. especially on a F2P model. But Turbine REALLY nickel and dimes EVERYTHING. The base game includes 4 zones (3 of which are primarily starting zones with 1 real adventure zone). You can travel to areas you haven't unlocked through the store but don't expect to do much. So many things you take for granted in other games (space, skills, etc.) beyond a bare minimum have to be unlocked. And they REALLY like pushing some of the boosts. Comes with the territory, I know. If you are incredibly patient, you don't have to worry about those things, but expect ALOT of grinding and expect to be incredibly sub-par others that are your same level.And P2W (Pay to Win)? If you pay for the boosts and unlocks, you are way ahead of the power curve. Pretty much anything can be had if you drop down some money.Thankfully, sales happen now and again where you can get deals on TP or, during weekly sales, can get things like quest packs or unlocks for half off. Coupled with the lotro store giving away a couple free boosts per week, there's hope if you willing to drop some cash on the game and wait around for a good sale.The ONLY saving grace is the ability to obtain TP (turbine points) on multiple toons that you can use towards unlocking the MANY features/content available. It's still alot of grinding. But I've managed to setup farming alts and a setup where I can earn about 200TP in about 90 mins. 3 runs and you can buy a quest pack for a zone.Score: 5/10 (Middle ground score only because you can grind out the TP's if you really want something and don't want to spend real money, otherwise, the score would be 1/10 because of how overdone and nickel/dimey Turbine is about things)StorylineThe storyline is an epic one in the true tradition of Tolkien (NOT the movies). Which means it's dry, long and kinda boring (to me, anyways). The epicness of Tolkien's writing is not in the writing style but it's broad and intricate vision and LOTRO captures that well, at least. There's a big world to explore. And LOTS of things in it.However, alot of that beauty is mired in meaningless quests for characters you care little about mingled with very boring writing. I'm a BIG fan of storylines, quests/missions, etc. and love to find out what's going on with everyone. But, for some reason, LOTRO quests are written so Tolkien'ish that the character dialogues seem overdone and I find myself not really interested and just skip reading it (for the most part). Additionally, there is no real feeling of storyline progressions (aside from the big main epic one). All the sub-storylines go all over the place and don't have real conclusive endings to them. Just an ""I thank you for helping me, kind sir. Goodbye"" with NPC audio chatter of ""Oh won't you listen to my woes?"" Score: 6/10 (Just for the fact there's ALOT of quests, at least.. not for the writing at all)GraphicsGraphics-wise, LOTRO is partially old school. Harsh, blocky edges (especially in notably older zones) and weird or cheaply done world animations (can you say Shire waterfalls?) and blurry textures/skyboxes plague the game. Characters, are overly, bland looking, lifeless and blocky. BUT, despite all that, the world is really beautiful. Maybe it's because I come from the old school world of Meridian 59, UO, and EQ1. It may be outdated.. but there's still beauty in it. The way the grass shifts when you run through it or the gentle babbling of a nearby brook while you walk through a meadow neighbouring a dense forest. Newer zones and areas get an updated treatment with cleaner textures and more polys per object/models. So at least the graphics gets progressively better. But you can tell some TLC went into some of the earlier zones albeit old-school looking. Score: 7/10SoundNothing remarkable about the sound. The background music is appropriately themed, albeit very looped and repetitive. There's some voiceovers (mainly for cutscene introductions) and NPC chatter. The NPC chatter voiceovers are.. annoying, in some cases. ""Excuse me! How rude!"" from a Hobbit lady I JUST helped. ""Oh! Won't you listen to my miseries and woes?"" from a human I just helped by saving his wife from being eaten by orcs. Maybe he DIDN'T want her returned? the voiceovers give a little bit of life to NPC's but they are rather short, repetitive and inappropriate.. hence..overall annoying. I'm spoiled by games like TSW that did voiceovers incredibly well. Score: 6/10 (what can I say? there's sound/bgm/voiceovers, at least)GameplayQuest mechanics are your typical MMO fare. Fetch this, kill that, escort that. There's just ALOT of them. All over the place. And there's nothing more infuriating than a SLOW npc that you need to escort. It's an MMO staple. It works. But I haven't come across anything that stands out like a TSW puzzle or WoW NPC event. No world bosses for the community to band together and defeat (RIFT). No random events that pop up and surprise you (ESO). There' lots of quests, occasional instances (with the ability to vary the party requirements or the level of the mobs), skirmishes (repetitive scenario training grounds), epic battles (if you unlocked rohan for post 50), 100 levels worth of adventuring, the ability to play ""bad guy monsters"" called Creeps in PvP level 100 combat against regular players, etc. Lots of different features, not all incredibly exciting.. but there's something to do, at least.Score: 6/10 (for LOTS to do, but not alot of enthusiasm to do it)CommunityEach server is going to be different. I chose Landroval (US-RE.. roleplay encouraged) and the world chat community is.. talkative. Helpful at times and immature/mature some times depending on the time of day or weekday/weekend. Community-run roleplay events tend to go on frequently with spatterings of actual roleplay going on in various populated areas. It's not bad. Most F2P games are packed with immature freeloaders. I can only suspect that the old style nature of the game and the nickel/dimey nature drove some of them away. That's ok. go play Archeage, CS:GO or Dota2, kids.Score: 7/10TechConnectivity-wise, I don't get much in the way of lag. Ping times are ok, even during holiday events. Though, I do get some odd lag bursts that I can't pinpoint as network-related. One of my friends have severe issues with LOTRO's port switching tech which leaves her able to chat, but unable to move until she gets kicked. At which point she has to go through the hassle of editing the conf files to manual change the ports because the auto-port switching doesn't work quite well (we suspect her ISP is throttling/blocking some ports). Graphics-wise, I don't run into much lag except in heavily forested areas or scripted scenes with raging fires, overall, I'm running around with 40-60fps easy. I personally run into a SERIOUS issue with the LOTRO store. It's laggy, slow-loading, doesn't reflect your current TP's properly and sporadically I get an access denied and nothing loads in it. Ok.. if you don't want me to spending money, Turbine, you could just tell me.Score: 6/10 (for numerous technical issues)OVERALL SCORELOTRO gets an overall score of 6/10. It's not spectacular, but it's not god-awful either. Although it has some saving graces, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Too many little things make this game not as enjoyable as it could be. Sorry."
"If you're a RolePlayer this is almost a must-try MMORPG. LotRo has one of the best RP communities on it's Landroval server that you will find pretty much anywhere. Fairly standard combat for an MMO, but the Rohan expansion adds quite a bit of flare to that. You won't find better in terms of lore, immersion, and a die hard tolkein fan base.The game's one downfall in my opinion is the free-to-play model that is currently in place. You will be spending a lot of time re-rolling characters and running the same zones over and over to earn enough points to unlock the next quest packs, expansions, bag upgrades etc.. etc.. My recommendation is to subscribe and get everything for a monthly fee, minus the expansions that will have to be purchased of course. "
"Boot up the game after installing it, tells me to log in with a Turbine account.Okay, I have one of these from a long time ago, it should work.Enter details, no subscribtion to LOTRO.Okay, go to their website to see what's going on.No information given at all.Look it up, find a steam page. Find out that if your account is older than LOTRO being F2P, you can't access the game and don't get to play it without making a new account.Uninstalled.Who the hell looked at that, who the hell thought that making it so that people with an old turbine account have to BUY a game that is NO LONGER FOR SALE. Which IDIOT was in charge of quality control? Which IDIOT was in charge of making sure that things work? For a company to just have that big of a blindspot is completely absurd, game can't be that good if that's the kind of crap you have to put up with JUST TO PLAY THE GAME."
"Played for almost 24hrs so far... It has done well at keeping my interest, though I wish that the skill trees were a bit more in depth and I find the craft groupings difficult to deal with.    Those two things aside I would rate this amongst top games of the category for ease of use, playability, and community."
"LOTRO is a game I would strongly recommend if the intended player is a fan of the Tolkien universe, and want to play a solid MMORPG in the meantime. It may be a little outdated graphicly and lacks some new content here and there, but if you want to just casually stroll through middle earth and discover the vast lore and breathtaking scenery, I am sure you will have a great time, aswell as when you reach the level cap and fight in Instances, raids and skirmishes."
"I've played this game for ages (since 2009). Thousands of hours more than Steam will show. It has been a long running favorite with huge amounts of space to explore and a skirmish system that other MMOs need to pay attention to.The downside is the game is starting to show its age a bit more than WoW does. The art in the game manages to land square in the uncanny valley and the player animation is sloppy. Anyone with a speed buff comically trots in place when starting or stopping. No ability to unsheath weapons, and everyone in your party will be synchronized when entering or exting combat. These things are minor, but jarring. Hunter's port system has become a chore, and travel from point to point to point is now confusing and tedious. Travel needs to be revamped to just a drop down of where you want to go at this point. Also, a lot of this game is simply NIH going extra lengths to not be WoW even when WoW-like was the right thing to do.The upside is the game continuously expands and improves. New gameplay mechanics, often new innovations, are introduced with each year. The lore is immersive (as it should be), and elaboration happens with consent and approval from the Tolkien estate. The cosmetic outfit system is an example of a place where WoW (and every other MMO) specifically needs to take notice. Content is often truely difficult rather than outright unfair, even when playing retro-content several levels under you.Warsteeds were a fizzle addition to the game, largely because they amplified the slop in the controls by an intentionally sloppy and unweidly system. PvMP (because WoW calls it PvP) is amazing, but often unbalanced as stats start in favor of monsters and end in favor of Hobbits by the end of an xpac cycle. Legendary weapons are not cosmetically customizable and obsoleted every xpac. This flys in the face of the intent of the original intent of the system, and is a very tedious grind. The legendary system is also confusing and dependant on huge amounts of randomness. Keep these as your forwarning as they will be the biggest sore points.Despite the complaints here, I still love this game. I still recommend this game. I hope that they will approach fixing the sloppy controls and simplify the legendary system as these are the only things causing me to drift towards other games."
"The reason I played this game is because a friend of mine has a mac only. (loser) At first I had some problems with the controls, but that's bc of the settings. (My own fault hahaa) Now I really love this game and I'm VIP now. :P It's like any other mmorpg i've played, but this time it had LOTR in it's story, so it's more fun for me and I'm takin it more seriously. Haha. Plus, the people in-game are very nice. Never expected that to be honest. :)"
Doing the free version and so far it offers enough to keep it interesting. Very similar to World of Warcraft so the learning curve wasn't too tough. Still might do the subscription but for now I am satisfied with what's available for free.
"A really fun and emerssive mmorpg. I like how Turbine could make a quality game other than D&D and have it so each character has a different story line, but they always lead to the same objective, get rid of evil. Anyone who likes mmorpgs or who likes lord of the rings, I would highly recommend it, to anyone actually."
"If you like games with a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of content, with the basic MMO type gameplay (go to this place, kill 10 of these things, come back, go back and get 5 of these things) but deep lore for Lord of the Rings and you can virtually explore all of Middle Earth. Takes a damn long time but you can visit everywhere in LotR. It's worth trying"
"This game is very fun and very addictive... a little confusing at first, but easy to get the hang of. You can also spend nothing on this game and get to the max level. Turbine allows us to do deeds to get turbine points which is what you get to get quest packs, classes (Rune-Keeper, Warden, Weaver, Blackarrow, Warg, Defiler, and Warleader), some cool cosemetics, and much more! I highly recommend this game, it also has a great community and many servers to choose from."
"Finally, an MMO with an immersive music system full of depth. Now I too can feel as if I were a musician in the world of Tamriel, in a genre of games that is severely lacking in the ability to perform music. It is my hope that more advances can be made in the field of virtual game improvised music. PS here is an original song I composed specifically for this game, just hit the corresponding keys in as rapid succession as possible after equipping an instrument. 9265872950934282394060932095995858555858555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555"
"I recommend this game because A: its lord of the rings. B: its a MMORPG. This game has some of the better graphics for a MMORG. It has a great storyline because it goes by the LOTR's books not the movies, and also who doesnt want to talk to Gandalf, Frodo, Aragorn (Strider) and the whole fellowship and many others that you can help. I have probibly over 400 hours on it even though most of it isnt with steam and I had it when the VIP was able to be bought for lifetime. Anyway this game is one of the best ive ever played and i think if you want to explore middle earth and play an MMORPG then get this game right now."
"As you can see i have alot of houres on record. This game is free to play and you can run around the entire world but to be able to do quests you will need to buy them. you buy them with turbine points. these points are also gained by completing deeds. So in fact if you want you could play this game completely for free but it just takes longer. I personaly realy like the game because of the realy big world and the manny possibilities you have withing the game.first off when starting you have 5 differend races to choose of and within those races manny differend classes (some don't work with some races). a few you have to buy with TP. there are 4 differend starting stories that help you to get to know the game. one of the big things on the side is crafting. you can make annything. in the differend areas are differend recourses.the grafics are not top notch but for such a huge game it is fantastic and if you have all the grafic setings maxed out you can find some realy nice vieuws. The social aspect of the game is realy important for manny quests are hard to impossible to complete on your own. thanks to the fellowships this can be done. And a mayor part of the time you will find yourself playing in a kinship. I met some amazing people from all over the world, some youngh some old (ranging 15-65) but all amazing in their own way.the game does allow in game voice chat but the quality isn't so superb.i personly love this game, the most time i ever put into one game. almost at 2000 houres."
"Even though I've worked on this, I will say that LOTRO is by far my favorite mmo, and one of the best communities on the internet. Every Lord of the Rings fan should give it a try.`"
the game is fun i had to delete it because i down loaded it throught turbine not steam so i couldn't use my steam cards to get the expansons. before i got this steam account i had aleast 100 hours played then i got a new account with all my game data but not my playing time. the game lets you wander through most of middle earth there are some places you can't go but that is fine with me. the story is great they realy incorporate you character in to the story of the lord of the rings books.
"Of all the different MMORPG.s that are out there in the world, of which I've tried a few different ones, I have always come back to LOTRO as it holds a special place in my heart. It's easy to say that since you like Tolkien's books you'll like that game or that film, however I think that very few games actually manage to capture the magic and mystery that Tolkien's books give birth to.I have played LOTRO on and off since the time when you couldn't venture further than to Mirkwood, whilst now you're almost at the black gate and very close to finishing this epic journey. The reason I keep coming back to this game is simple, they keep adding more and more content and I want more and more lore and just the feeling of adventuring in Middle-Earth. It's just one of those feelings which is really hard to describe, but nothing will ever compare to exiting Moria after ~1weeks worth of time (IRL) questing in the depts and then being treated to the glorious Lothlorien and their beautiful forest.That said, the game is not without problems and is at this point really old, however, if you can look beyond the slightly blurry textures that show that the game is old, there is much to love in the game.The combat flows smoothly, sometimes there are a few problems with pathfinding for the enemies, but these are few and far between.The lore inside of the game is canon as far as possible, though the developers have taken some liberties in their designs, of course, though I would say that there's nothing that is terribly lore breaking and you can enjoy this game and get your geek on without risking the ""Peter Jackson syndrome..."", looking at you Hobbit...Is this a game for everyone? No certainly not, no one game is for everyone, but you don't need to be a Tolkien geek like me to enjoy this game. If you take some time to read the descriptions for quests etc. you'll find yourself learning loads about the world in no time. Basically, if you've ever had an interest in running around Middle-Earth and slay orcs, I'd say this is one of the better games to do that in. It may not be as big and fancy as WOW or other MMORPG:s but it makes up for it with stories and grandious environments for you to visit.Touching on the F2P models slightly aswell. I have ever only played the game while it's been F2P, this because I was too young to be able to uphold a subscription before then on my own. I find that the F2P model is quite fair and you're even allowed to gather Turbine Points, their currency for the in game store, though questing and doing deeds in the world.Although I would strongly recommend that whoever enjoys this game and would like to improve their life a little, should subscribe for just 1 month and then go back to playing, this will bring your account up to premium level, compared to the F2P version, giving you a lot of quality of life improvements to the game, such as more bags, higher cap on gold etc.You will be allowed to quest up to ~Level 20 in the game for free before being required to purchase more regions to unlock the quests that lay within. Giving you, in my oppinion, ample time to form an idea about the game and decide weather or not it's worth spending that ~5â‚¬ to unlock more stuff. I did and I've never looked back on it as ""wasted"".Is it perfect? No, but good enough to warrent countless of hours of playing, weather you're a Tolkien geek or no. Give it a shot without paying money and if you like it, there's a lot of content to be enjoyed here, for not too steep a price."
"There isn't enough I can say about this game. Being a huge Tolkien fan, this game gives me the sense of Middle-earth in a proper form. The classes are really fun and mostly balanced (certain unbalanced classes, though not unplayable are always getting fixed), the world is exciting and fun to level up through or just explore. The community is really helpful and are always ready to help someone in need. Crafting is great as well. Decorating your house was a really nice feature, but Standing Stone Games recently upgraded it and I haven't seen any other housing decorator system like it. To put it simply, it's amazing.I think my playtime on this game will say otherwise since I can't say enough. If you're interest in picking it up, please, do yourself a favor and do it."
"It has been a few years again since I started playing Lord of The Rings Online. In this period of time I encountered some ups and downs. Especially in the beginning of time, when the servers were extremely bad and most of the servers were dying out. After the recent developments considering servers, it came to my attention that this game is starting to rise again. I speak from the bottom of my heart when I say this game is perfect for the average Lord of the Rings nerd and especially the fact that it is free to play. However, it will not be easy to level up after you have reached level 40, because you reach the areas of Moria, Mirkwood, etc. This requires expensions. If I speek freely though, I would recommed buying the expansion pack, with the summer sale for example. Please note, since this is not a steam game, you have to fill in the codes on the turbine website. You can add me if you find yourself struggling, or if you just want to do some skirmish, if you play at the Evernight server ofcourse, my character's name is: Ashallil "
"Last December 2015 is my starting point to this game well my expression was soo great! i feel like Aragorn and feeling like playing the game WOW , btw i already quit wow during the finish of Lich King Expansion that is my best memories of all time , anyway this game Lotro is great cheap and free to play, all you need to do is buy the 3 DLC on the steam, which give the expansion the the required quest pack evedim quest for lvl 30-40 and now the newly dawn will give you TURBINE points which you will need to buy the Angmar Pack in game store for lvl 40-50, then thats the start of your DLC expansion pack between 50 to 100 lvl, i have little tip for you! also WAIT FOR THE SALE!!!! its a big help ask the admi about this or people in the game.... i would like to say this game is 11/10 for me lol!!!! am lvl 43 waiting for sale of quest pack heheheh i already buy those 3 DLC on steam is its great not disappointed , or you can play the game for a while  to check it .... Godbless LOTRO and player and a good game!!! MAIN character Vinear Captain Sub char: Rune Keeper Chidory and Warden Recca"
"Ok I must admit, lotro is not top of the line on their graphics, combat, or dialog. But this is not what draws me into this highly-adictive game. This game has such an awesome comunity, and ITS LORD OF THE RINGS for goodness's sake! All the diferent classes, the skills, the festivals, (and I have no sense of grinding btw) the detail in the landscape, session plays, PvMP, and the epic story which is worth a whole movie in my mind. These are the things that invite me to keep playing. New content and features are always roling out, and even if it is not all 100% lore-acurate (Eg. The Beorning), I have learned to enjoy and get a ball out of it!Yeah if you are impatient, you can spend some money, but it ISN'T required whatever anybody may say. And who is to complain if you spend $20 on a game? If it is worthwhile, GO FOR IT!"
"really good gamplay for a free game, definitely worth playing. the help section is pretty horrible and needs work, so when the game doesnt work you pretty much have to figure it out for yourself."
"This is a GREAT game to engage in! My only suggestion is the addition of transport withouthaving to purchase it with turbine points. In addition, a more reliable connection link and a larger variety of classes, armour, and weaponry would be great! All else is AMAZING!!"
"people are nice, graphics are not all to fancy, but that's not neccecairy. even if you are a free to play, you can still reach nice stuff. people who think you have to pay erverything might not have noticed that certain achievements give you a bit coins for the shop. so if you work hard enough you'll have enough coins for a mount or something cosmetic. even a free player can buy a house and maintain it (you'll just have to work a litle harder for it) so people nagging about ""oh no it's free to play but you need to pay to do annything"" might be a bit blind. i admit, the beest stuff you'll have to work realy realy hard for (believe me i did that) but still, this game is one of th ebest free mmo's i've ever played."
"I've been playing this game for quite a while, Shadows of Angmar days in 2008.I have stopped with this game quite a few times. Yet I still comeback and play it.It's like the classic MMO but with the LOTR lore, sounds awesome.The game plays great, even though they use target-tabbin, I have yet to see such fluid combat in other MMO.It feels great. You really feel like you're hitting or being hit. This is one of the reasons I keep coming back.The PVP can be freaking awesome and incredibly tedious. Questing can actually be fun, but to get from 1 to 100 should take so long that I'd doubt it feels fun after a while.PVE used to be really great, but the old content is abandoned and they haven't released a new raid in a while now.The community is one of the best assets of the game, I have made quite a few friends for life over here.Finally, with all the great things I had to say, and that keep me coming back, I must say:This is Free-To-Play until some point. You can always play it, but you'll eventually need to take some money off your pocket to unlock later content. The currency you buy, Turbine Points, can be gathered through gameplay, but to get enough would take over a thousand hours.P.S.: This isn't a P2W game. They surely sell a lot of convenience, and people who pay can really get to that point with less effort, but they don't really sell advantage (anymore)."
"Absolutely epic game! If you like The Lord of the Rings (and even if you don't), this game is just plainly amazing. It can seem a bit overwhelming at first and it takes a bit to get the hang of things, but once you get going, it's addictive to death. Something great about this game is that the free content is huge, unlike other free games that limit you to the point where it's no longer fun; and actualy, with a LOT of work, you can get enough in-game points to buy everything that is for sale. I haven't been so hooked up with a game in quite a while, definetely recommended!"
Love this game! Its fun to play however I wish they would focus more on fixing the game up then making money all the different fees to play turn me off from playing. If they would just have one set fee for the month and thats it then I wouldn't mind it if they were upgrading as much as wow does.
"I LOVE the LOTR universe, read the books, (the hobbit like 4 times) seen all the films. When i first saw this game i got excited beyond belief, in this game you can go to all these locations, just from looking at the map i got excited, but what drove me away recently was the HUD, it's a bit messy, and the map with quest markes also is quite messy, in my opinion the HUD and quest markers need a redo, and some slightly better graphics wouldnt hurt. But i reccomend it to all other tolkien fans."
"So, I've played through the intro of this game and done a bit of free roaming with my friend, so I thought I'd give some first impressions. (The Quest Log section may be updated, so you may want to check back at some point if you're interested, which I expect you aren't).PLOT:Judging by the intro and the dream sequence at level 5, your character (my first one being the Hobbit Burgular, Mimbulius) is the chosen one (or something like that) whose destiny is tied to the fate of Middle-Earth! The story is set out in quests that vary depending on which character you are (my friend was a dwarf and met Gandalf and Thorin and all the other dwarves from The Hobbit while I was just helping out around this little village that got attacked for five minutes).GAMEPLAY:Open World, quest-based gameplay. It is very much like World of Warcraft, but it's still a good MMO. QUEST LOG:Day 1: My friend and I set out from Erebor on the free horses they give you for 24 hours after completing the intro, and we decided that we were going to go from Erebor to Mordor, stopping at certain locations to look around. We rode to Hobbiton, where we found Bag End and looked around, then we headed off into the Bree-Lands to find The Inn of the Prancing Pony. My friend thought he could take on a bear, and it chased us all the way into Bree. At the Pony, I got my haircut and got drunk, while my friend sold all his junk items to Barliman Butterbur. We then set off for Weathertop, as my friend did not want to stay the night in Bree as to be safe. Weathertop is in the Lone Lands, what we now know to be as quite a dangerous place for two Level Sixes to be riding through at night. My friend was lucky and actually managed to make it onto the ruins, but I, however, was attacked by some freaking ravens! Meanwhile, my friend wasn't having the best time up on the hill, and he managed to use some magical item or something to teleport back to Erebor. It was just me now, so I rode on, past Weathertop, to try and go through the Trollshaws to Rivendell...I was killed two minutes later, and used my instant respawn, only to be killed again about twenty seconds after. I then respawned at a safe place (the entrance to the Lone Lands) as day began. My ride through the Lone Lands was fine, and nothing attacked me at all. If only my friend had actually listened when I suggested waiting in Bree until morning. I entered the Trollshaws, and the game warned me that this area was Level 30, but I was determined. I rode through the Trollshaws, with monsters chasing me. I reached the river that seperates the Trollshaws from Rivendell, and rode on. I could not see a path to Rivendell, so I rode up a hill to get a better view. At this point, I stopped, and, as I checked the map, the monsters caught up with me and attacked me. I moved away from the monsters, and they chased me. I moved back again, forgetting a crucial detail - I was on the edge of a hill. I fell 200ft, still riding my horse, and died as my body smashed into the same river I had believed to be the end of my worries. I had to use a 'Safe Respawn' that took me to the middle of a place called Archet, on the borders of Bree. I left to go and play Town of Salem instead."
"Overall I love this game and would recommend it to anyone. What I like about this game is that there are a lot of things to do from customizing your character, weapons, clothing, housing all of it. There are lots of quest too some some of which are repeatable. You even get to pick a trade like woodworking or being a scholar just to name a few. You can join a kinship or start one of your own and help eachother out. You also get to interact with the original characters from Middle Earth like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and so many others. The one thing I think is a drawback is that you have to spend money to unlock most reigons in order to be able to do quest in them and there are some other items such as mounts and clothing that you need to buy with money as well. And there is a gold cap so you have to pay to expand that as well. So unless you have a job, or some deep pockets you can dig into and if you're not a giant passionionate fan for Lord of the Rings then this game is mostlikey not for you. But if the above is not an issue for you then I would totally say this is a great game for you. :)"
"I love this game!  It's likely, if it hasn't already, to surpass World of Warcraft because the only thing you have to pay for is only additional content, not required to proceed in the game!"
This was the real first MMO I ever played and beacuse im a big LOTR fan this game hits me right in the heart.I really recommend this game to any lotr fans or MMO fans out there looking for something new to play.//A fat and tall dwarf.
"I recommend the game, but I would much rather prefer you to pay $30.00 for a two-month Battle.net account and pay another $30.00 for World of Warcraft online or at Walmart which is much better. I think this game is not near as inteesting and I don't think there are many fun quests. I still haven't figured out how to get trained in mining. I saw the trainer on my mini-map, but I never found him. It's like he just disappeared. I still think it's a nice game for someone who is new to MMORPG games, and when you're experienced, get World of Warcraft. I do like the combat system, though. I just wish that the creators would add hundreds of more enemies and enemy types. And also make it to where it doesn't take me half an hour to find a mining trainer. I still like it, though. Even if this review sounds like I completely hate it. It's a free MMORPG, and that's what made me want to get the game. Maybe it's because none of my characters are high leveled, and that's why I don't get many fighting quests. Good game, though. Thank you for whoever read this review. Have a good day!"
"To properly appreciate this game, you need to invest a fair amount of time into. I would say the game itself is a fairly standard RPG, perhaps above average for a free to play and it doesn't bog you down in restricted VIP only areas. However, a big selling point for me was the fact it was LOTR and I got to explore all the places I wanted to visit from the films. This was FRIGGIN AWESOME. I admit, I spent the majority of this game playing with friends, so I cannot vouch for the solo experience but questing together was the most fun I had on an MMORPG.Throughout the game, you may be able to save up enough currency to never need to invest actual money into it, however I bought the mithril starter pack which gave me enough points to progress as far as I wanted. The first purchase you need to save for is buying a horse to actually be able to get around. This is relatively painless and involves completing a fair few early tasks to get the points. Apart from that advice, take your sword, your bow and your axe and go out and explore the world of MiddleEarth!"
"The game itself is really huge and you will see a different mission wherever you go and you could spend a lot of time of spending your time on side missions then on the actual story missions. If you are a completionest, then this could end uo as a problem and may find yourself over powered in areas. Over all, it is enjoyable."
Logged in made an account  found a kinship found a fellowship smashed the ♥♥♥♥ out of some Orcs! friendly community  stop reading this log in and help defeat the evil that is Sauron and purge your enemies in the fires of MOUNT DOOOOOOOOOOOM!
Great game! Played it for two hours this morning and I am already hooked! Graphics are alright and you dont need a gaming PC. The quests are very interesting and the game itself is fun! 10/10
"Hello, I am an old wargamer by heart.  Lotro is quite a amazing mmo, sure there is great graphics and such.  I play it ,because of the story.  The game covers rpg, crafting, dungeon crawling,cosmetic and good people who like to help.  I hope that you would try this game and remember were else can you CHOOSE your on path.  So, download it and get to it. Cya in the game Fundenberg."
"""...and one ring to you, free of charge"". Lord of the Rings online is the best Lord of the Rings game out there, trailing ahead of The Third Age, and Battle for Middle-Earth. This is because it encompasses the largest interactive chunk of Middle-Earth out of any of them. You may begin your journey in the humble Shire, where you will experience the joyfulness and naivety of the hobbits. From there, or any of the other fine starting locations, such as Bree, you will slowly make your way through some of the most well-known and previously unknown locations of the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's famous fantasy land. Take a stroll through the Old Forest and have a chat with cheery ol' Tom or take a seat and drift off to dream land in the dreary atmosphere surrounding Old Man Willow. Too mainstream? Get more underground and plunge into the depths of the Mines of Moria! If roleplaying is your thing, the Landroval server is host to one of the best communities in any MMO around. Join the fight today!"
"I love this game! i've always wanted to traverse the world of middle earth and this game lets me do it. The customization options are practicaly limetless, and the gameplay is amazing. It's unique in a way because you have the option to use instruments! It is probably my second favorite feature of the game.so what im basically saying is... PLAY IT!!!!!!"
"If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings and enjoy playing games like World of Warcraft.  This beautifully combines the two into a well thought out and engaging game.  It plays wonderfully solo, in a pair and in a fellowship."
"I like this franchise a lot, and I like this game too. It does open a lot if you pay to play mind you! I find that with this game once you get to Mines Of Moria thing's start to get a lot more interesting, for instance to enter the mines, they give you a Legendary weapon. Also, the areas in the expansion packs look very pretty, the Vanilla game does too, but the expansions even more so. I think the zones are very big as well, sometimes too big, but then again they are pretty acurate to the books. I think my favorate questing area has to be the Hobbit area as that place is the most cheerful and colourful too. For anyone thinking of playing this game, do yourself a favor and get a Subscription, even if it's only for one month, as it opens up four bags, and removes the gold cap, and gives you 500 Turbine Points to do as you please with, plus any character you make in that month will be able to learn to do their riding traits for free which will stay with that character even when you un-subscribe. Overall, if you read the books and liked them, you will propably love this game. If you only watched the movies, then this game may still appeal to you, but one thing to note this game is based on the books not the movies. A good effort by Turbine in my opinion and nice to see they didn't shut it down!"
"This was one of my first MMOs and I am so happy it was. The combat and graphics may seem a little outdated but it is still fun beyond belief. It's not easy but it's not too challenging, it's super fun to play with your friends, the map is GIANT and there's so much to see and do. Within my first few days of playing I was invited to a guild by very nice players who taught me everything and showed me how to play, I progressed slowly until I was a total bad♥♥♥♥♥ I spent hours looking for the correct ores to make the best weapons and armor possible. The gameplay is perfect. You start out by fighting wolves with a weak short sword and leather armor and a few days later you'll be taking on orcs and giants with your friends and dual wielding swords that took hours to make and heavy steel armor. THe progression is quite slow which personally I love. But that may bother some people. You can do epic boss fights and raids to earn special money that you can spend at camps to get weapons and armor that look like they were crafted by the gods. This game is also truly free to play. If you want to spend real money on special coins go ahead but it's definitely not forced upon you. You can do everything without spending a dime. I played this game all spring break with my friend. It doesn't matter if you have an old mac and a poor mouse. I spent the majority of this game on a mac and a poor mouse and it ran perfectly. This game may not look like it but if you put the time and effort into it, it will blow your mind. If you can get over mediocre graphics and sorta outdated combat then trust me you'll love this. Anyone who appreciates a good MMO will absolutely LOVE this game!"
"Best to get this game if a few of your friends do as well. It's fun, but when you're running around an accurately re-created Middle Earth WITH your buddies...wow. The fun. Lots of it."
"Very fun game if you're e LOTR fan and always wanted to explore Middle Earth. Players are always friendly and willing to give a helping hand if you're stuck or need some help clearing a mission or skirmish.  Does require a bit of grinding though if you're itching to get to a particular location and explore, but there are ways to level up quicker if you look for them. All in all, a great way to pass the time and escape reality for awhile."
A great 3D game in a MASSIVE middle earth world. Works best using directx 9. Takes minutes to learn but years to master. Join me on the Withywindle server by sending an in-game mail to Bobberry.
"Lord of the Rings Online.. Is it good or bad? I would have to say this is a generally good game. This game is very much your typical mmorpg game. The controls are very simple and easily understood. You spend most of your time in third person observing your character, combat involves locking onto a target, then clicking (or using a hotkey) to trigger the different attacks that are displayed on your action bar. Area attacks do exist, and generally the physics play out reasonably well. The World: The world is big. There is plenty of places to explore, and the graphical level is pleasing to look at. While it will not match up in freedom of movement, or detail to Skyrim, it is definitely a fun place to view and explore. At first the world will seem pretty small, it is only as you go along that the distances between locations grow to the point where it is unpleasant to travel there by foot. They did, however, do a good job of matching up when distances get long, with when you your character can get a horse. In summary: medium-big world that is aesthetically very pleasing to look at. Questing: The questing system is very closed. You progress through them, some of them are voiced, most only have one or two lines of voiced dialogue the rest you have to read on your own, you rarely have any options. They do not support the player choosing to be evil or good, or making choices that will have impacts upon how the quest will progress. Despite the limited nature of it, they did a fairly good job of making stories that are interesting, and that fit with the lore of Middle Earth. Summary: lack of player options, but decently entertaining anyhow.Characters: Character setup is highly limited. You can choose from four races (Dwarf, Elf, Hobbit Man). Then you have a group of Classes;[some titles may be wrong] Guardian, Champion, Burglar, Warden, Rune-Keeper, Hunter, Captain and Lore Master. The races share the classes, with a few classes being disabled for each race (for example no Dwarf Burglars, or Human Rune Keepers. Each class also has three 'paths' that they can follow, those will effect what kinds of weapons they will be good at, and how well your character is at solo play. In general, there is almost no cross-over between classes, and no way to change once you make your character, so research well before you make a choice. Crafting: There is almost nothing to talk about here. You choose a craft that contains three skills. Some skills let you gather, others let you craft. No single craft you can choose is completely self-reliant, so you will need the help of friends or the general world market to level up all of your skills. Crafted weapons are, however, well worth the effort of getting. They are on average far better than what you can find through loot for your level. General play: While this game is termed a ""role-playing game"", there is very little actual role-playing to be found on it. The role-playing servers rarely have players who actually actively try to take on their character's roles. There are some good communities that you can join in with, but if you are on your own do not expect players to be particularly sociable or in character. Outside of role-playing the community is very open and helpful. Questions are typically answered quickly and nicely, and there are almost always players around who are willing to help you out. There are also plenty of player friendly guilds/factions out there to join if you enjoy that kind of play. tl;dr, generic mmorpg, with its biggest highlight being that it is based in Middle Earth.  "
"Pros:-Fabulous people still do exist in this game. Sure, there's a rough people mixed in, but I've met a good many folks who are incredibly kind.-Lots of quests. Too many almost. Too much to do. Can't keep track of all of my quests. Help.-A fine F2P model. And being a VIP (a subscriber) is pretty great too. Either play style is great.-Great stories. You even get to assist the Fellowship at times.-As of this year, we'll be able to SIMPLY WALK INTO MORDOR.-If you love Tolkien's world of Middle Earth, then you'll never want to leave.Cons:-Optimization issues. Lag can be your biggest enemy in this game. Certain over-populated zones are sometimes horrible for certain players.Still a very good game, despite its age. Hop in, talk to some people, join a kin. Enjoy."
"Man... I STILL love this game. <3 Beautiful music, graphics, and great main quests and kajillions of super creative/awesome/stupid/hilarious side quests. So many things to do- up your reputation with this people, collect relics for that people... build a fellowship, buy a house, the Yule Festival... Fight with Aragorn, visit Legolas and Boromir in Rivendell... it's endless <3 I have a couple characters, but my lvl 29 guardian elf is my best so far... My only complaint is how many turbine points simple stuff costs... at least they're only extras. The best value would probs be to go premium and buy a couple currency packs but ain't nobody got time for that. xoxox Love you LOTRO <3"
"I have played this game almost 300 hours i came back from time to time from other games because lotro got something that i can't descripe .In the beginning its hard to get it al right because it can be overwhelming but the more time you play you really enjoying it.Pro's:-story is really good-you can do almost everything by yourself-large world -you will always learn something -very good wiki-good crafting systemcons:- after the lonelands you have to buy the next area's- some worlds are really empty - some parts are really confusing - hard to find good people for instancesPS you can earn turbine points for buying next area's , quest pack ,...but at the time you know are at that point you got TP enough to move along ;) "
"One of the best games I've ever played.Graphics engine was made so long ago and yet still so smexy. The plot can be a bit dragging sometimes, but when you're with friends charging through dungeons, epic war, or just other stuff... yeah, it's like Borderlands on a Rampage or an actual fellowship bent on taking down all of Sauron's Army in a harder hack-and-slash madness combat style (note some of you may die given leveling is ridiculous)Not to mention, free in-game for killing hundreds of bad guys to unlock really cool stuff. What's not to love?The game's not ""pay-to-win"" and it has a very active community. PLUS!!!! Most of the lore and story are like shadow plots in the movies and don't ruin the Canon or Lore (unlike some other Disney-bought franchises I know....)Overall 8/10 now. 9//10 when made. 10/10 with friends."
"I've been playing this game for 2 years or more and though I do not consider myself a connoisseur of Tolkien's writtings, I know enough of the lore to interpret whatever artistic agenda the developers included in the game.    Many of you might ask,""Is the world size on scale with the books ?""Answer is yes and no, if any of you know the technicalities of a (MMORPG) PC game, then you'd prolly understand what it means to host a game world(with decent graphical features)  that has hundreads of kilometers in all directions. The game has a classical MMORPG outlook of Middle-earth but the walks between Bree, Shire and Blue Mountains aren't as tiring and long as it would be if the game was 100% canon.Mind you, there's a very complex process in recreating scenarios and plots when you try to make a game or a movie from events of a book. Likewise, to make a movie after a very complex game. While not impossible, the quality won't be the same, and from a fan's point of view, might as well burn the whole thing... No no, I'm not going to start a discussion about what the Tolkien society thinks of Peter Jackson's works or any of the other bs. My point is that you will encounter some artistical improvisation in the game that might confuse most of you Middle-earth fanatics. Bear in mind that making a balanced game world, even with Tolkien's ideas, requires some improvisation here and there. As such, you will encounter areas, monsters, bits of unknown lore, either made from scratch or continued from the bowels of all speculations. ""Does that diminish my gaming experience as a die hard Middle-earth junkie?"" That depends on you  really, while the atmosphere is very canon, you have to delve into the game to feel whatever charm it has. Try the music system of the instruments you can find and learn, go fishing, explore areas that aren't too dangerous. Do you feel dwarf-ish today? Go mine ore to make armour, shields, swords and axes for your kinsmen. Feeling like a greedy dwarf today? Go mine jewels and make amulets for your...self. The game is F2P mind you, though you will need to pay a monthly fee to have acces to advanced areas to quest around, though you can make micro-transactions in the store and just buy the quest packs you desire. Want Angmar, Evendim, Forochel and Moria quest pack? Sure, knock yourself out. Also, bear in mind that the main Epic quest is free to all players.Too frugal? Just do slayer and exploration deeds where you receive Turbine Points which you can use in the store to buy game content you desire, traits, unlockable craft guild traits and so on. There'll be a bit of work to be done through that method but there's no hurry either way, especially when dem discounts are lurking on the horizon ;)Am I talking too much? No, YOU'RE dilly dalllying too much, you filthy Tark."
"Not all my hours are not logged here.. but I can assure you that Lotro is worthy of an investment in 2018. Most negative reviews are from people that either 1. dont like the new monetization changes (which IMO are not even that bad) and 2. those who didn't even get past the tutorial phase. An expansion released not long ago, the community is small but has good amount of subscribers, most people are friendly, overall everyone is dedicated. PVE is fun, the story/quests are overall good, the environment and world setting/feeling is unbeatable- without question... Even though the graphics are dated, tolkiens world is mirrored so well in this game. Its awesome just to be able to walk around. Something this game has that other MMOs dont have (with the exception of Swtor and maybe Star Trek Online) is a healthy franchise behind it (outside of gaming) that is still popular and producing screen content. Look at  Lord of the Rings recent movies, and its upcoming Amazon TV show... There will be no shortage of fans and growth to supply fanboys like myself to continue exploring this game. This will still be relevant in 3 years becasue of how awesome the world and its lore is. All that aside, the game itself has very solid PvE and good class variety. Really fun dungeons especially in groups. Character customization for Armor/Gear sets is better than many MMOs that have released in the last few years. Never seen 2 players that look like twins.  You dont have to pay to get a mount or anything and technically speaking, you can get expansions for free if you grind, but i recommend subscribing because its really worth it for all the content you get. If they were to upgrade the graphics here and make it look modern, there would literally be no reason NOT To play this game. So if you can tolerate the graphics, dont let that small factor stop you from experiencing this. After a while, when you start having a lot of fun, graphics aren't even noticeable or relevant. It's all about how much the story, environment, combat, and progression suck you into the trap. Lotro sets that trap fairly well. I'll end it there."
"Play this game. Why you ask? Well it's a dream come true for any of of the LOTR books and movies (me). The fighting is fun and immersive, PvP is realy fun with friends and fighting a Balrog is the culmination of my life experience. A truly free to play game with only one area requiring a subscription. Altough you do need to GRIND for free purchase of some late game areas. BUT once you get them you shall not be dissapointed, Gondor and Rohan are really fun. The game gets better the longer you play, while the dwarf start can be tenous all other are pretty good. Soon you're trailing the fellowship and participating in sieges. Skip fowards to retaking the Dwarven homeland of Moria or defending Lothlorien. But soon even better, the devs are set to release the highly anticipated Mordor release very soon. Finally we shall to take the fight to Sauron in this amazing RPG that is dare I say (forgive me) better than WoW. So please play this game, the community will welcome all with open arms and the devs will listen to you. All that's left is deciding what race."
"Played this game many years ago, long story short I didn't remember my log in and was slightly upset. Got back into it and man, what a ride, love the story and the soundtrack is top notch. I recently got my first 100 and have been enjoying trying to decide which outfit looks best. I highly recommend this game.Edit: Now a level 105.Edit Edit: 115"
"Great game, might be abit old but thats 10+ years worth of content and over 100+ hours i've played i've barely even touched and seen everything this game has to offer.If you like lord of the rings then you will enjoy this alot more, well worth the time invested.9/10"
"I used to love this game.  Then, after they released the update for Helm's Deep, they abandoned the whole skill tree, and re-did everything.  I felt overwhelmed...I had carefully planned my character's development over LITERALLY THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay.  Yes, I know that there's something wrong with that.  In my defense, between bouts of grinding, there was something terribly soothing about standing above the valley of Rivendell.  But how could I start over?  Without the skills and perks configured, MOBs of my own level would likely waste me.  Yet if I mis-spent them, I'd be stuck with a fouled-up configuration, unless I paid to re-spec.  So it sits in the queue, unused.  I thought Minas Tirith was available now...I had so longed to make my way to the White City.  But even that appears to dangle out of reach.  (thanks Dr. Wumbo for correction)  Perhaps someday I shall yet return...some day...ah.If you enjoyed the books, and have a LOT of extra time on your hands, and sometimes find yourself wishing to spend some time in Tolkien's world, you could hardly do worse than to spend some time with this game.  I bought it long before it was free-to-play, and it was worth it.  (Shoot, I'd have bought the lifetime sub back when it was available if I had known how much I'd like it.)  And if you're starting now, you needn't face my conundrum...unless Turbine does it AGAIN, in which case it may be time to craft a new legendary weapon. "
"The Lord of the Rings Online is a vast and beatiful MMORPG that allows you to enter Tolkien's world!  This game will keep you coming back for countless hours on end!  Explore regions such as the deep mines of Moria, the dark woods of Mirkwood, the vast fields of Rohan, and even the icy region of Forochel."
"Lord of the Rings Online is a fantastic game. It's one of the best MMORPGs I've played, and it's F2P. For Tolkien fans, there's nothing better than this. It's also good for those who enjoy immersing themselves in their character and the characters of players around them. Come join me on the Landroval server!"
"Been playing this since launch. Glad to see it on steam! The F2P model is not the best, with a very pay as you go mindset, making you purchase quest packs as you level. This can be avoided by paying subscription.The MMO aspect is also a bit dated, but this means there are mountains of content to enjoy.This gets consistently updated with new, and free content, as well as expansions on a yearly basis. The story is well into Return of the King by now.If you are in any way a fan of Middle Earth, I recommend trying this one out purely to explore this interpretation of Middle Earth, as it is the most fully realised one to date.You can walk from the old fortress of Carn Dum in Angmar, all the way to Dol Amroth in Gondor.You could follow the path the fellowship took, or even that of Bilbo to some extent.This is a fantastic game for the role players and explorers among us."
"Wow? Huge map featuring pretty much every place from the movies, the MMORPG basics are on point, and well so far this is just great! Why haven't I heard about this before?A must try!"
"I've not played much of this to have a highly knowledgeable opinion of the game, however it seems pretty good from playing a few times. Like the other MMORPGs it doesn't fill the void in my life that UO did, though it seems to have a more mature player base than WoW or a lot of the other similar games out there at the moment.I like that it's free.I'll update this review if the game ever hooks me in."
"This is one of the games which I have dedicated most game hours. The community is friendly and helpful (I play in Landroval server) and the game has enough things to do to keep you busy and having fun, as well the players organize different type of social events that add a lot of value to the overall gameplay."
Fun game for anyone who likes tolkien and mmorpgs and dont mind paying for their gameplay even in a f2p. After the first 20 levels you need to pay pretty much.But if you like roleplaying tolkien its great.
"This game may lack the astonishing graphics of the new gen ones, but there is something about it that still drags you to play forever. Personally, I think it is my love for Tolkien's universe, and I really recommend this game to any fan of the Middle Earth."
"Ah the world of lord of the rings has never been more peaceful.  When i had this game i loved it so much. I was a big fan of JJR Tolkens classic. i played as mostly a wizard class and i tried to gain enough level to gain powerfull magic. So far ive taken to being a lore master with the ancient lore tech tree and i think i was a big schollar on it too. Although i was all about launching powerfull magic though i was not the guy youd exspect i had to always get up close and personal with enamy figures and teaming up was no  option unfortunatly for me. But it was fun also being able to summon beasts like gandalf was pretty cool too. Besides my horse which was natural even for non Lore master players to create out of thin air i was capable of summoning a powerful bear and then eventually a funny looking crow. The bear i named wilbur because he is tough but quite playful too when roling around on the grass. My crow friend i forget cause i have not played in a long time but i loved the way he was agressive because when i needed him most he was quite distracting while flying in front of others pecking their eyes out. I laughed a few times too when that happened but as for friends id must say the community aspect was kind of droll until i started playing as an orc on the other half of the game. i made a few friends some as spiders, maybe even once at least a Nosgoul.  We had fun acomplishing out objectives and taking the forts but in the end i had to stop playing the game. Despite how cool it was it was getting to a point where it was too laggy for my computer to handle. I could not join massive battles and when things got ugly i was always that guy who fell back because everything became to choppy in a certain area to play even on lowest quality possible.  I will miss playing this game but i will recomend it for other players.  Just try and make sure your PC can handle it though."
"The best MMO out there at the moment. It might be 6? years old, but manages to keep fresh. There is tons of content to go through and no matter what playstyle you seek, there ought to be something for you to do. I tend to prefer solo play with a bit of team-play when my time allows it and really enjoy the story driven quests, that bring me through all the wellknown places in Middle Earth."
"the chill of the night air wore on me. it had been 2 days since I last slept, and the weight of all the pills I had taken began to warp and wear on my mind. I couldn't think or feel anything without first wishing I was warmer, but regardless of this, I had to keep walking. Each step rang out on the concrete like a gunshot, the loudness of them eroding my nerves like the many weathered beaches of new jersey. it was then I saw it. I saw her, my angel. she was all of 4'3, and in a wheelchair. she was bald and proudly displayed her colostomy bag atop her chair with a bright red anarchy symbol. our eyes made contact and she waved to me, her facial expression blank. as I approached, the overwhelming smell of feces and axe body spray hit me as solidly as my hands on many brick walls. she looked at me and said nothing. her head erupted in a gush of gore and pus. a long insectoid head crawled out of the newly created orifice. My experience with LotRO was very much the same."
"As a young man of Rohan, your biggest threat to your life is the impending Urukai Legions, and those pesky hobbits of Hobbiton. Venture into this amazing world of half men, and elves. Master your steed, (Mine is named Snaggletooth) and venture into battle against the forces of Sauron.I give this game 8 Hobbits up."
"Simply put for any fan of The Lord of The Rings Series (Die hard or just liked the movies) you'll enjoy the overall depth of this game. The lands and towns are beautifully crafted. The sheer amount of things to do is immense. So much to do, So much to learn and there isn't a diffinitive ending. The game is one of my favorites and is well worth the 20GB's of storage required to play it. I could go on forever about how great this game is. 9/10 Fun Factor (MMO Gameplay)9.5/10 Overall Rating For Sure!!!!! (Gameplay & Graphics)"
"LOTRO Is full of opportunites to actually complete a game for free. With the ability to earn free ""turbine points"" and unlock areas, classes, etc. you can make your way through the game for free with a little effort. The points are able to be earned in abundance with the access to multiple servers as well. The game quality is fantastic and the varying ways to play are really inviting. Overall it is definitely the best mmorpg I've played yet. Lots of holiday festivals which are awesome, however in recent years they have made the items way more time consuming to attain."
"I played this game for over 6 years and put 1000's of hours into it from alpha in 2006 when the level cap was 15 to 2013, every game system is designed to be a major grind so if that's the kind of thing you like then it should keep you busy for a long time"
"I reviewed this game a number of years back prior to the Riders of Rohan expansion. Today, players are enjoying the dark land of Mordor and looking forward to further adventures in Northern Mirkwood, Dale, Laketown and Erebor.If you enjoy the works of Tolkien, you should already be playing this game. If you enjoy a well-made MMORPG, you should give the game a try. It has aged well and the in-game experience has only improved since decisions ceased to be made by Turbine. Standing Stone Games has done a fantastic job delivering better quality and giving the players what they really want."
"I think this game is very acomplished even how old it is now and the developers are always brining us out new content every few weeks and a new expansion each year. Many people still play this game, although there is no PVP area, PVMP is very unique because you get to play as an orc and fight players in the ettenmoors. I have always loved the lord of the rings series and enjoyed all the books I highly recommend checking this game out."
"LOTRO offers hours of fun and gives any intrigued fan a glance into Middle-Earth. But as the campaign progresses, the side quest in new lands disappear and the amount of experience needed to reach the next level gets longer. While the environment is quite spectacular, the progress becomes strained."
I had always loved the Lord of the Rings books as a child and this game is also a wonderful story telling experience that in my opinion rates highly right along with the books. I have already put in over 100 hours and I am not sure I have even scracted the surface of what this game has to offer. This is one of the far better options for anyone wanting to try and mmorpg. Its free to play so really why not give it a shot? You have nothing to loose.
Grind-tacular/10pro-its free up to a pointits tolkenintresting in universe lore expansioncons- doesnt break new mmo groundtired old quest designpay-to-play dlc gear looks like paper mache mess until upper tiersnot sexy korean mmo style female armorbasically a run of the mill mmo with a tolken skin
 There is just something about this game that sparks my excitement like reading a great fantasy novel.  The graphics are superb and are always being improved upon.  This is one of the few MMORPG's out there that are always trying to reinvent themselves by adding new combat systems and revamping existing areas to bring in more players.   Turbine has a true gem here.
"***ILotRO...Lord of the Rings Online. I played this game for well over 200 hours prior to it's STEAM release and have 2 max level characters, and all of the optional classes***I'll keep this short and sweet...this game is absolutely wonderful! One of the best MMO's that I've ever played. Also, the roleplaying servers are very active, and this game offers the best roleplaying that I've ever experienced in any MMO, hands down.The only drawback is this games age, because of the age of this game, the community feels like it is slowly dissapating. While still a very friendly and helpful community, and honestly one of the most mature communitied I've ever seen in an MMO, the player base seems to be dwindling so much, that it may, at times, leave you feeling alone.If you haven't played this game, and are ok playing alone, give it a shot. If you have a group of friends to play with, give it a shot. If you're patient enough to have periods where it seems like no one is online, give it a shot. This game is great!"
"If you're willing to log many hours into this game, it is very, very enjoyable. By playing the game totally free, like me, you must spend a lot of time doing tasks and completing skills in order to get the Turbine Points needed to advance in the game."
Been playing this game since very first month for 10y so far. This game keeps having it's ups and downs but I reccomend this game to anyone who would like to dive into Tolkien's world as it has his flavour :) Can't wait to play a new race which will come out together with Mordor this summer - a high elf ! :)
"Great Game very fun and lots to do leveling is pretty easy and fast, crafting and mining are great and the immense environment and strait forward battle controls are great for beginners to the MMO genre"
"I have long history with that game. I first played with trial account because I didn't have lot's of money to buy games. But I liked it so much that I made several trial accounts just to play again and again and again. Then I bought Mines of Moria. Best underground setting ever. It was so massive, so dark, beautiful and horrible at the same time. I have many good memories with that game.Yes, it is old. Yes, game mechanics are old too. Yes, legendary grind is annoying (though they are working in fixing that with imbue system). Yes, combat is clunky and quests feel same. But the atmosphere is great, community is wonderful and it still can suprise you with how good the world looks even though it is running on old graphics engine.I take sometimes pauses from the game, sometimes for months but I always return. Because of the people, because of the world and well... because of Frodo."
"If you are looking for a new and great MMO-Game, you haven't found it yet. This game simply said is a clone of World Of Warcraft. A clone with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI. A clone with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI and p2w stuff. Don't do it. The game is 18GB big and it definetly is not worth the download."
"Absolutely a fantastic game after re-vamp of the classes and polishing the world. This game has unrivalled atmosfear!I am truly impressed by this game, and for the very first time since it's release I have high hopes of raching end level tus experiencing my favourite fantasy city when they release it in an expansion: Minas Tirith!I always met the wall around level 30 before revamp; levels got slow, and the ""induction"" time, which are much less noticeable now, became unbearing.This game is now a strong 8/10; would be a dead-sure 10/10 if there was so that we could create a character on the ""dark side"" and level it up in it's own zones; PVMP doe's not really stir my interest in the way game is, but as a PvE game it surely is a gem."
"This is a wonderful game even though you have to pay quite alot to get the important stuff in the game, if you are not willing to grind for the necessary points. Still, there's a lot to do in Lotro and there's a nice selection of races and classes to play with. The world is huge even for those who go purely F2P. And with the expansions and quest packs it's insanely huge. I recommend this game even with the F2P restrictions, it's well made and it entertains for a long, long time.9/10"
A great adaptation of the Lord of the Rings books. The landscape is gorgous and being able to visit all the iconic places is awesome. The game is very story driven with and excellent epic quest line. Overall not terribly grindy and you level at a good pace while experiencing a lot through the various regions.
"An amazing a huge expansive world that is all free. I would put plenty more hours in if I had the time, don't let the early tutorials turn you off, because the rest of the game is absolutely amazing. "
"Should be called Nickle and Dime of the rings Online, IMO. They aren't content with you subscribing to their game, you have to unlock additional features by spending real money, even after purchasing all of the expansions. Get 50 gold in the mail from your friend? Not so fast, we're going to hold 45 of that gold hostage until you unlock the currency cap. The questing system is essentially 300 variations of ""kill 8 orcs(or goblins, or collect 8 things from dead orcs)"" mixed with other useless sidequests that add no value to the story. Whoever did the quests in this game was tragically lazy. None of the quests are bundled, you can do several quests in an area, turn them all in, and the quest giver or the next quest giver will just give you quests in the same area that you could have gotten while you were in the area the first time. The world is great, it's very large and detailed. There are hundreds of towns and cities everywhere. This game could have been a AAA mmorpg if it wasn't for the nickle and dime cash shop and whoever designed the quests."
"First off, this game is great, for both Tolkien fans and people who haven't even seen the movies. This game has everything it needs to be a great MMO. Here are some more details with pros and cons:So the best part of this game is easily the story, I play for the stories. The Epic Quests are generally the best, but there are some really cool side quest lines too which are fun to play along. It's also cool to have Monster Play, to be able to conquer outposts and hunt down Free Players is quite satisfying. The classes, at least from what I've seen, are all unique and fun to play, each in their own way, which is cool too. Here's some stuff to keep in mind though.THIS GAME ISN'T TOTALLY FREE. Or at least, if you want to play totally free, it's going to take a TON of effort and a lot of hunting random creatures to fulfill deeds to get LOTRO Points. But there comes a point, after you've finished playing through the Lone Lands and you've played along the Epic Quest series in the North Downs, that you have to buy Evendim to continue the epic story line, which is usually something like 700 LOTRO points, and by that time I had raked up about 600, and there was, luckily a sale going on. But, I'm trying to make the point that in order to continue playing the game you are going to need a lot of LOTRO Points. Aside from that, other cons include the fact that Middle-Earth is too stinking massive and unless you use LOTRO Points to buy yourself a horse, you have to run everywhere, at least until you've discovered all the stablemasters. So that can be pretty boring.But in the end, I still find this game enormously entertaining, You can make it all the way to Level 40 without even needing to worry about buying another region if you follow all the side quests. The story is cool, engaging and original, staying true to Lord of the Rings Canon, while building off of ALL the loose ends that Tolkien left out there to create really cool stories. So yes, I highly recommend this game."
"I've spent a lot of time on this game, but I prefer to run it directly than run through steam so it didn't show the correct playtime. The game is fun and rich in content. You can visit many places of interest of middle earth though the map have only reached Rohan. But it's updating pretty fast, maybe we'll get to Mordor 2 years later? The graphics are good, but it's still feeling outdated a little. Go play on some populated servers. It's free to play. When you reach some locked quests, you can just buy the expansion that contains the quests. And it's pretty balanced. Just try it out, and playing alone isn't fun for me, I don't know about others.If you're a LotR fan, and you haven't play this yet, then you're missing out a lot!Go try it with one or two of your friends. MMOs are always better when you play with others~"
"This was the first MMORPG I got into, so I'm pretty biased. Recommended for people interested in a mostly casual mmo with a pretty friendly community. Also people who want to run around and explore Middle Earth. The world really captures the atmosphere of the books. Great soundtrack."
"Lord of the Rings Online, or Lotro is one of the older Mmorpgs out there. Like the name of the title suggest, this game plays out in Middle Earth where you can play as a Hobbit, Human, Dwarf or Elf. Each race has its own background story but will eventually merged in to a in my opinion Rich storyline where you help the people of middle earth and the fellowship of frodo and his companions. If you are a fan of the movies like i am then it won't take long to fully emerge your self in to this game and even learn new things about Middle Earth it self.So...? What can you expect from this game then? As for Dungeons and Raids nothing to challenging, wich in my opinion isn't all that bad, i have seen other games where they make it so damn hard people just rage quit or can't be bothered to play it after a hard day of work or school. What is new (mostly for ppl that used to play this game back in the days) is that deeds (kill for instance 200 orcs or complete 30 quests) are much more important then before and for ppl that are looking for a quick breeze through the game for max level and then hope to enjoy the end gaming this is made possible (unless you invest alot of $ in the online shop)For player activity? I Am playing on the europe server Snowborn and there is lots of people online, never had a moment where i didn't meet someone while playing.Free To Play version of the game. You may or may not ask you self, Is it playable with out spending a Dollar. The answer is NO. Some of the expansions aren't free, and if you're not in the mood to grind deeds with multiple character you miss out on a lot of coin that is needed to unlock many things in the online shop. Ultimately whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you. Like i said above, It maybe free but you gone spend money in the end anyway, that is if you want to see and be able to do everything this game has to offer. Other then the financial aspect its still on of the better online games out there and i'm sure with the release on steam the game will get a boost in player numbers, so in the end i give it a YES on recommendations even with cash you most likely gonna have to spend."
"I've been playing this game since 2008. (We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)Ever since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it ""cost money"" to do anything...News flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.Here's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.The issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...Anyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.Play the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.Long story short, See you in the Moors.~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamedP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)Yes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)"
So just got this today (Late to the party or what) but I love it <3spot on lore its book/movie counter parts !!12 levels in about 6 hours (left it running for a couple when i was doing other stuff woops)pretty stoaked !!! 
"I really do love this game, but it's be legit if I had more people to play it with. I made a legit Hobbit with a freakin' pimp hat, but unfortunately have no friends to show it off to...Please... Let me show you my hat..."
"Great MMO consisting of a generic combat system with great story telling elements and questing. There is a ton of content includng expansions, raids, and even a unique PvP (PvMP). It is technically free to play but you will need to spend some money to get the full experience. It is outdated compared to newer MMOs but it is still being updated and expanded. My personal favorite MMO to date."
"this game is amazing,i played more then it says because i didnt had steam back then. if u like lotr, then u will like this game. u will see some stuff back from the movies. u can choose wat classes you want and wat kind of race. the gameplay is also good. lots of quest and other stuff u need to do. if u have the focus to keep grinding then u will come far. i will play this game again when im done with ds3 :poverall: 9/10"
"Got this game because of my friend, I hate him now... Not because of the game, the game is pretty good. He just sort of annoyed me because I asked him yesterday if he could pick me up for school so I wouldn't have to be the only Senior on the bus again... But he said no. I don't get it, where did I go wrong? 10/10"
"It's one of the most generic MMORPG games out there, but with it's own twist to things. However you still have to do things like grind, do long and boring quests, etc. Beginners may get bored but trust me eventually it'll be better"
"This is another great alternative to WoW for the free to play gamer. You can complete the came without ever paying although it will take a bit longer. As with Rift the graphics and in game AI, I would rate very high. Easy to use controls and an over all good gaming experience. I recommend it."
"So its time to find a new game... your bored of everything else in your library, if you are looking for a mmo rpg that is not dead such as WoW or Tera. You have come to the right place, today as I write this review Feburary 6th 2017, this game is alive. Ever since a year or so ago, they cut down their many servers with a average amount of players on it, some more than others, into a few big servers. This seemed to help restore the community although it did divid a few friends from old servers. The graphics on this game are good for the year they came out and are probably one of the better graphics found in most mmo rpgs, the content is fun, but to really enjoy it you have to enjoy the universe which it takes place in, like you wouldn't play Star Trek online if you didn't know anything about Star Trek. Although the game is based on the books and movies of lord of the rings, it has its own original feel to it, with its own sort of story and characters, although you get to see the characters from the books through your quests, and can even aid them in battle. With 10 classes and 5 races to choose from there will be lots of variety to choose from. Next, the community is probably the nicest I have ever seen, besides the few trolls that linger in world chat, you will meet many kinds of people, the role player, who no matter what sticks to their role, the pro alt leveler, who is on leveling his 10th character and solos everything and kills the quest targets for you, and the guy who you will probably be, the person who invites everyone they see, be it to finish a hard quest or to play a quick skirmish to get on to the next level. Find a kin that has a history and that you feel you can connect with, if you are starting to play this game with a group of friends, start a kinship and slowly grow. The devs on this game are actually not bad, of course its easy to complain about the game designers of any game. Usually if you have a complaint give them a fair amount of time and they will reply back. If you have read this far then you are probably interested now your next question is, ""Is this game pay to win"", the answer is yes/no if you are either young or retired you can spend plenty of spare time completing deeds to gain ingame currency. Although there are expansion packs that are a must, but if you get that far (first one being at lvl 50 ""Mine of Moria"" then you probably really like the game and should consider spending the like 20 US dollars on it. If you are still unsure if you wanna play this game, just download it, its free."
"Middle-Earth is a much busier place since Lord of the Rings Online went free-to-play. Bree is packed with adventurers running between contacts and crowding around traders. Elves ride giant goats through the cobbled streets. A hobbit stands on a wall, playing the Legend of Zelda theme on a lute. To the east, the killing fields are full of adventurers blasting bats and boars back to the Second Age.There's a good reason for this renewed popularity. Free-to-play games are never completely free, but in LotRO there's a huge amount of content to enjoy before you're forced to lay down any cash."
"Playerbase is great, very friendly and willing to help in any situation. Crafting system balanced, makes every craft appealing with ups and downs. Moderate battle system, nice animations but pretty basic battles. Nice dungeon system though. Would recommend for newbies to MMORPGs, LotR fans, and experienced players willing to work with people of different ages and skills.EDIT 9/24/14: Extremely P2W when over level 50. However, Turbine Points (real money) can be earned in game, even though it is very slow. I wouldn't recommend investing too much time in the game, but it's worth a try, I guess. Somewhat. Ish."
"LOTRO is a good solid game for LOTRO fans, for new players is might be alittle harder to come to but over all you'l get there ,the story is great and i havint even gotten that far yet but it does have outdated graphics. Graphics dosint mean the game isint good or anything, just that mabey afew rich textures here and afew rich textures there wouldint hurt. Over all i would recommend trying the game at least because you can really get hooked if your in the mood. In my honest opinion i think the team should step it up, get more updates!, not so much the lore but other things that you guys have been wanting to do for awhile!."
I love the story Line going along with the books and keeping aline with them plus the Towns and Settlements you arrive at with your Hero are very well done (Minas Tirith was a bit of a downer though. :( ) But Standing Stones is a lot better at maintaing the game and its story line plus a couple of years of more content as we venture closer to the end. :D
"The only thing that keeps me from playing my vast Steam Collection is LOTRO. Been playing for 2 years and with over 700 hours of gameplay - I cannot say anything bad. If you like wow but dont want to pay .. LOTRO is for you. Or if you like GW but want more, LOTRO is for you. HIghly recommend!"
"An amazing compliment to the J.R.R Toiken books and Peter Jackson movies,  LOTOR Online allows you to do what you want and go where you want in middle earth while not forcing pay to play or pay to win for that matter down your throat."
"WoW clone set in the best realization of Tolkien's world.  Whether you follow in the footsteps of the fellowship or take a detour to Angmar, prepare to thin Middle-earth of its bear population."
grate game but some minor suggestions ... the play monster needs a more in depth story line or missons that take you different places like the reguler game mode but again grate game 11/10
"I only say this to hardcore fans of Tolkiens Middle Earth in the Books. People of the movies may be disapointed. But as a hardcore fan I would recomend this game. But if you are not a really big fan of the books, you will not get half of the places in the game."
"If WoW have great story, great game, great endgame and the WORST community ever, LOTRO have great story, good game, reasonably good endgame and the BEST community ever, which is the reason to keep playing :) I have tried WoW several times, reached the endgame, start raiding - do not do enough dps - kick, made a silly minor mistake - kick... kick for this, curse for that.... wtf.... In LOTRO this couldn't happen. I am constantly joining instance fellowships and raids if I am 2-3 lvl behind or not with optimal gear. And nobody will say anything against that. The entire community is totally helpful and understanding. I hope that the game will be there at least for 2-3 more years. It deserve it!"
"Firstly, I have been playing this game on and off for almost 5 years. I have spent more than 1000 hours on it and I have experienced every part of the content it has to offer. No other MMORPG had me coming back like this one did, but the fact is that the game is not so popular these days, yes, you can find lots of people to play it with, but compared to 3-4 years ago.. it is dead. I started playing again, two weeks ago, after a little break to see how the game evolved with the new content that is available right now. Endgame is really good with the new instances from Gondor, epic story is in North Ithilien, getting ready to go into Mordor which is exciting, but sadly, the game got really grindy and by grindy I do not mean grinding instances and raids which is fun, it is about gathering hundreds of flowers to exchange for armour and doing Featured Instances once per day to get recipes for essences you need to put on the slots in the armour. Daily quests exist too and they get boring after 2 weeks of doing them on a daily basis. Also, take into account that if you want to play this game to its fullest you will need to subscribe for 1 month to remove gold cap and unlock traits and bags. PVP is boring, coming from a player who is mostly looking to PVP rather than PVE. Creeps are in a good position right now and freeps just wont come to the Ettenmoors to fight, now that it is challenging. Also, everyone plays the FOTM classes which leads to the Moors being stacked with 30 creeps while the freeps are on the stairs of GV afking. As someone who plays this game, I surely recommend it to you because it has one of the best communities in the gaming world, everyone is nice and will help you. I will end this by saying that this game has the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen and it is truly a superb experience to see every location in the book and movie, to fight Mordirith, Saruman, the Nazgul, Mumaks and so on. I will forever play this, even though I cannot play it for more than two months  without a break anymore."
"With likely over 3000 hours into the game, only about 850 of which I have logged on Steam thanks to playing it without and playing in offline mode, LotRO has been the epicentre of my MMORPG experience for nearly a decade, and I believe there it will firmly remain as long as the game is alive. There as a lot that Turbine has done correctly and well with this game since its conception, and very little that they've done bad that really could take away from the experience. As the game now stands with the same developers under a new studio, hopefully with greater freedom and budget to do as they like, I have nothing but a bright and shiny outlook for the future of the game. The community is one of the most friendly and positive I've known, and community-run events are plenty in addition to the seasonal dev-run events. 10/10 ~ I will continue to ~always~ recommend it to others to at least give it a shot. It's definitely my favorite way to get my Lord of the Rings fix alongside watching the movies and reading the books. :)"
"Such a good game with a lot of content. Playing WOW for so long, I always thought it would be awesome to have a LOTR themed MMO. Been playing LOTRO for several years now and while it has lost some of its luster, it's still a fine game with a decent enough chunk of content to be a good f2p MMO. If you like LOTR, check this out."
"Very good game. I have much more hours then the current ones. I played the non-steam one :DThis game is extremely nice but with some cons:->Pretty repetitive sometimes->P2P game. You get around 30ish, then you need expansions to go higher. Same♥♥♥♥♥♥as monster, there you need to be P2P from the beggining. In the rest, this game is super fun."
"I think Lord of the Rings online is a great game, the problem I am haveing, is , I can not play it for more than 20 minutes before it crashes ( the blue screen of death). Is there anyway I can fix this issue and play the game for a more extended amount of time and NOT have it crash?"
"PRO's1. You can be a bear and slap orcs.2. You can wear pants from the Grey Company.3. Free.4. More than 10 years of Gameplay.5. It's LOTR6. You can be a bear and slap orcs.7. You can be a ... You get the idea.CON's1. Who cares, download it, play it and love it."
Honisly LOVE THIS GAME takes me back to the good old days of mmo and mass open world takes me back to D+D and got to love Bolders Gate ohhhh yes and WOW when you dident haft to Pay somet like £300 just for 1hr of Game play <= abit drmatic But love this game honisly :)
"I have played LOTRO since 2009. Every time I try to leave cause I put too many hours or too much money into it, I always come back in a couple weeks. The community is great, you will make friends pretty easy and raids are always a great way to pass the time."
"This is a game that you need to have friends and do the side missions. Solo it can be great if you love Tolkien universe, but with friends it goes into another level of amazing. You can definetly do the first twenty levels without paying, however if you want to get past that you will have to buy quest packs to unlock quests in other areas. If you don't want to do that you can do the challenges that are highly recomended to do since they give you stat increases and turbine points (what you use to buy stuff). Even though it says I have very few hours on this game I mostly run it through the normal client. I probably have close to three weeks in play time. If you don't like MMO's or want a game just like WoW this may not be for you."
"when you entered you will find best community and ofcourse best epic quests with amazing maps full with beauty of middle earth and you will have many best friends i mean real friends and good mmorpg players they dont insult you or they dont trolling your questions on global or kinship chat , they are not leave raid or fellowship just for a few wipe opposite if somethings wrong they call extra help from their friends or they change the toon, your kinship mates dont take charge for crafts or items because you are friends! and when you ask help for craft on glff everybody try to help you and craft items for you without fee! this part of is kind of dreamy...but one day sauron type greedy warner bros involved this amazing story with full of hunger of money and the turbine with full of mistakes for example 10mn long raids and unlimited farming mode and bugs and expensive expension pack without no raids in it i cant describe their money hunger if i need to give a example they even sell lvl50 character -with full of item and virtue ready to enter the moria- on store to make money !!!!they dont care players p2p or f2p and f2p part is a lie if you dont buy maps your only choose is farming skirmishes or finding a friend for farming dungeons!they are broking game over and over again and they even didnt know what is the problem and how they can fixed so game closing like a few days and so many apology to earn more time to fix it and the last option giving you a turbine point as a gift for extra day to fixes... i still love lotro because of community and recomending just for those players! join lotro and see the best mmorpg players at any age from anywhere of world !!!!"
"Amazing Game, Friendly Community, and It also convinced me to be a LOTR fanThe World is Massive and full of AdventureAlthough you can play alone, It's a crack ton of fun when you play with a fellowshipPlus, There are no trolls ruining your game Best MMO I've ever played20 pop tarts out of 16 oreos"
"This is an example of how to make an MMO correct , even though i really don't have that many hours on record , i enjoyed every second of it so far and can definetly see myself spending a few hundred hours roaming a beautifuly created game .69/10 would watch a village burn again"
"I cannot speak for the game as a truly Free To Play experience, having been a Lifetime subscriber since the beginning.  Nor can I give any inclination into the Raids or larger group play that comes at end level.What I can tell you, however, that this is a truly rich game world that can really suck you in.  The various ways to progress are immense.  Bar the Mines of Moria expansion, which I found a slog, this game has never been tedious.  The landscape is rich and varied.  I've lost count of the number of times I travelled into areas far over my level just to explore.Arguably the game has got easier over the years, with the map practically pointing you directly to the quest objective (rather than some vague area) but it does help speed your progression.  And, I guess, you can switch off the help.I do not think you could find this game as entertaining if you aimed to spend zero on it.  It would undoubtedly be more of a grind than I found Aion.  You need to purchase the quest packs.  The Epic Quest line is good, but some of the zone quest lines are equally fantastic.And, no matter how hard I try to utilise a different Starter area, I always come back to The Shire.  The tranquillity of the area is made even more beautiful when you go further and further afield."
"Lord of the Rings Online is definitely an MMO game where the journey is far more important than the end goal. If your focus is on levelling as quickly as possible, skipping the quest lore, you're missing out on a great deal in this game. Although you can take shortcuts with money, you can earn TP through time and effort in-game to buy things from the store, such as new areas. The game definitely rewards having multiple characters, and the variety of the playstyles of the different classes makes each interesting to play. The most important part for me, however, has to be the setting of the game. I was genuinely excited to explore this amazing world, and it really brought the world from Tolkein's books alive for me. There was a sense of wonder and awe as soon as I begun in Ered Luin, and it hasn't diminished for me, even after many hundreds of hours in Middle Earth."
"i haven't played this mmo in years but have recently come back to it. it's a very great mmo and i've found myself really liking it. the community is extremely mature and friendly, and you have the choice of soloing the game if you have no friends prefer playing alone."
"Although often feeling like a micro-transaction dominated world, LOTR has done what it can to survive in the changing climate of MMOs. The game will eventually require money to be spent in order to progress meaningfully and also to reduce frustrations in basic gameplay aspects such as gold caps and inventory slots. Despite it's repetetive enemy models and requirement for endless travelling, LOTR really shines in bringing Tolkien's world to life. The game has very accurate depictions of characters and tales from the mythology, whilst providing an outstanding feeling of immersion through a beautiful soundtrack and carefully crafted environments. Some of its systems such as music composition and housing make it one of the best MMOs out there for atmospheric and paced gameplay."
"in my travels far and wide in the lands of MMOs, I have found this one to be both a great psuedo RPG, second to the Old Republic alone, and the best fantasy fix for the least money, unless you simply want to play on a private server for your game of choice. Great fun, if a little seemingly deserted at times."
"Thought it was about time that I review this game.I am only 75 hours in so far, but I am having a great time!As a long time WoW player I was looking for an MMO to sink my spare time into and this game has delivered.I will say straight up, this games graphics/mechanics are NOT as good as WoW but to me it satisfies me in a different way.Firstly the community is very friendly, in the last 75 hours I have only seen 1 or 2 trolls in the World chat channels.Ask a question and you get an actual answer, unlike WoW in my opinion has a very toxic playerbase.Questing is the same sort of thing in both WoW and LOTRO, kill X amount of this, collect X amount of that.Dungeons and instances, I would say that WoW does a better job here. Although the few lower level dungeons I have done in LOTRO are pretty fun.Now onto the UI, the UI in LOTRO is absolute aids. Mods only help to a degree but the UI in WoW is alot friendlier.Plenty of side quests, crafting and hobbies to be had in both games, and again WoW seems more simpler to get on with.To summarize, both WoW and LOTRO are your pretty standard run of the mill MMOs.... BUTAnd this is the shining and winning factor for me, its LORD OF THE RINGS.If you are a huge Lord Of the Rings fan then just that fact alone will make up for all of LOTRO downfalls, the size of the map in LOTRO is amazing, all the places you know and love from the LOTR series are here, Mordor was released recently but that is endgame content so I can not comment.Real life cash aspect? 3 classes are locked behind a paywall, you get less inventory space and a few other small restrictions, but if you enjoy the game then just subscribe for VIP status, its priced at Â£8.99 per month and is very cheap in my eyes considering what this game brings me.TL;DR  You will love this game if you love LOTR"
"I'm not really a fan of this game, for the game itself, but the roleplaying community is better here than on any other MMORPG that I have found. Smaller, but that means you get to know everybody. I recommend it for peopel who want to RP, but if you're looking for a game that'll be fun to level and do engame stuff, or PvP, I would look elsewhere."
"I find this game to be endlessly entertaining. There is something to do for everyone, be it story line questing, buying and furnishing a house, crafting items, exploring beautifully creative lands or farming experience form countless hordes of monsters. The free to play feature creates an opprotunity for you to dive in without worrying about if you will be able to pay the bills for the next month. With the ability to work on deeds and quests for turbine points for free this game creates a world in which you can live the life of a lord of the rings. I highly reccomend this game for people with time to set aside and friends who enjoy quresting and adventure."
Honisly LOVE THIS GAME takes me back to the good old days of mmo and mass open world takes me back to D+D and got to love Bolders Gate ohhhh yes and WOW when you dident haft to Pay somet like Â£300 just for 1hr of Game play <= abit drmatic But love this game honisly :)
"This is a timeless classic. I remember when the first website appeared for ""Middle-Earth Online."" The excitement was indescribable. When it released, it delivered on its promise to be a living, breathing Middle-Earth.Ten years later, it is still relevant and one of the best MMO experiences out there right now. Whether you are an old-school Ultima vet or entirely new to the MMORPG space, give this game a try and you won't regret it."
"Amazing if you've patience. Hate that the packs have to be bought for separate regions though. For someone who doesn't pay monthly, it's a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I'd happily have paid money upfront to know I had access to it all."
"A timeless classic that gets better with age.  Beautiful graphics, story (goes without saying), sound and content make this a must play for anyone that has even the slightest interest in what a premier MMO experience can offer."
"For a normally paid game, this is a great download. The free version doesn't let you:-have a full inventory space-fully access some areas and quests-trade money,etc. BUTbecause it's free, the stuff that you DO get is a really good deal. most of the time you don't feel like you're even missing anything!Definitely worth a download"
"I really like this game, I play as a Beoring, fun class where you can switch between man and a bear form to unleash powerful attacks.  The cut scenes are a nice touch when you see what is happening with the fellowship while you are on your quests.  I think visually the game still looks quite good for it's age and has not aged poorly at all."
"While it says I have 7 minutes on Steam, I played at least 500 hours of this game before it was here. The reason that I have not restarted playing it is because seeing the game again was to much nostalgia for me to handle.Lord of the Rings Online is probably one of the best RPGs out there, even though it doesn't have a massive playerbase like some other ones. The community is very friendly, and this is especially important when you have the ability to create and join Fellowships and Kinships. The combat is simple enough to understand easily, yet advanced enough to not get boring after playing for as long as I have. The landscape of the many lands you can visit is very well made, with amazing mountains, valleys, and of course, plenty of enemy buildings to raid. The enemies are fun to fight, especially if you find a randomly generated boss wandering the wilderness. This game also has great economy, with ways to earn large volumes of money at low and high level areas. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good RPG -- I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."
"This is an absolutely phenomenal work. I love the gameplay and the customization that you can do. I have only one gripe: I wish they didn't make the expansions so expensive. I don't have a lot of money, and furthermore I'm not good at earning Turbine Points. Doing the deeds does make this task easier, but it is always a total grind to perform. Besides that, I think the game is a wonderful thing, and I hope to see more of it in the future. Also, I love making up stories for characters. It really means alot for me to be a part of the lore of the Lord of the Rings mythos (Technically :P)."
after 30 lvl you have to purchase every single map with turbine points for that you need to farm deeds for days/weeks/months or purchase a vip..  (free to play) for sure. Mostly people in eu don't even bother to help or reply not all but most
"Has its (big) flaws such as bad questing system, extreme backtracking and dated combat and graphics but it still has one of the best fictional worlds ever created in the history of video games. The world building and lore are just phenomenal even after all these years.They just don't make games like this one anymore. Period"
"The download time was very long, I must say - half my playtime was just downloading on the launcher. However, from what I've played, it is SO worth it. The combat is simple and easy to pick up, the gameplay is fun, and even running long distances doesn't get boring. Plus it is so satisfying to beat the living s*** out of some guy who jumps out of the bushes with a dagger and tries to kill ya. 9/10."
"I got the retail copy of this way back for $10, played my included month and let it go. A lot has changed since then. The free to play model is a bit frustrating at times, mostly just on inventory space, but once you start playing you realize that points to unlock these features gradually show up as you are questing and doing your regular stuff anyway. There's a lot of content and yes you do have to pay for each expansion but if the game is pretty playable without a monthly sub how can you really complain? Combat is faster than I remember but slower than other MMOs. If you want a bit of a flash back in game play style but not have the awkward clunkiness of everquest this is for you. The visuals have aged well too and there are still times you can stop and admire the art and scenery. Give it a shot, get to level 20 on one character and see if you like it. If you do then they have a $40 expansion bundle that will give you loads of stuff to do. Plus it's middle earth!"
It's intresting but the thing I dont like is that your not free to go where you want. Its a roleplay game I didn't know this beofre I downloaded. In all opinion though I give a 7/10.
"Many years ago I left that Blizzard game to come to Middle Earth and never looked back. I've played this game since and recently docked it to Steam in an OS reinstall ( thus the low number of hours here ). Premium membership is highly recommended but you can have a good time for quite some time for free as well. Epic character music capabilities ( my Hobbit minstrel plays a mean Misty Mountain Hop ) are unique and envied by other games. Scalable raids to your party's level of choice. Solo instances that are also scalable by level! Massive crafting system. There are things and systems in LotRO I've seen blatantly copied by other games, including that Blizzard game. Oh, my characters can also smoke pipeweed! A real pleasure playing this game for all these years. I cannot say a bad thing about LotRO."
"Graphics:The people that are saying this game is dated or doesn't look good are playing on medium. Especially if you are able to take advantage of DSR or other similar technologies and run on high to ultra-high, this game still looks AMAZING! Just be patient and tinker with it.Gameplay:Combat mechanics won't blow you away, but that's not what traditional MMO's are for anyway. HOWEVER, the way each class plays is VERY unique and interesting if you take the time to learn them, thus making the combat feel less clunky than it probably is.Leveling:Questing is similar to the snatch and grab MMO model; however, a good bit of story and random traveling is incorporated as well (in a good way) to allow you to explore a bit and familiarize you with what is happening around you, story-wise. You are eligible for instanced content at level 10 but don't expect to jump right into a group instance because it won't happen, the low levels are populated but you level so quickly most people don't even think about instances until they are eligible for skirmishes (skirmishes are so♥♥♥♥♥♥End-game Content:There is plenty to do at end-game; however, like any other MMO, it will take you some time to coordinate and find a group for any serious content completion, BUT the potential to do so is definitely there.Community:Best of any MMO I've ever seen, players are constantly offering up items for free to newer players, quick to hand out advice, and most of them, excited to help you on your journey throughout middle earth.TL;DR -- DO NOT let the bad reviews prevent you from downloading this game. If you are TRULY a fan of traditional-style MMO's (think WoW) you will most definitely enjoy yourself. The players complaining about things being ""slow"", ""dated"" or ""clunky"" merely do not know how to configure their settings for the game to run properly on their system."
"Product received for freeDespite my time in this, I really love it. I have gone through stages of playing getting stuck and quiting througout this games life. I've recently been picking it up again, though on Steam and would like for all of those RPGMMO lore loving fans out there to know, This Game Is F*&$ing Amazing, if you can get past the wierd controls and being underleveled, (becuase This game is more then a few years old.) Pay to play and pay to win? No such thing while it does help to get the bonuses of the in game devil deals known as micro transactions, you can just play level up get better gear do more quests, grind, etc. The story at the beginging for almost all races goes from 0 to 100 real fast. Great game for LoTR lovers though will♥♥♥♥♥♥on your knowledge of the world."
"Hmmm, where to start?  OK, if you're an old-school WoWer then you'll love this (after you get over the graphics).  If you like the current dumbed-down WoW then you'll struggle to pick up LOTRO.  There's simply not as much hand-holding as WoW, but in ways that's better as you have to really get into the game (not just endlessly run raids and dungeons as in WoW nowadays).  And you really can play to level cap for free (I've met people in game that have done so).PROS: Crafting system is good after you get the hang of it, and you really can make better items than the drops at the same level.  The auction house system is good too.  And having your own home can be fun.  People are as friendly as they used to be on WoW and I haven't seen a single farmer bit yet.CONS: It is free-to-play BUT it is very much structured to make playing without buying TPs (Turbine Points) as annoying as possible.  For a start, there is the 2 gold pieces money cap - you need TPs to remove that.  And you can hit 2GP in an hour's play.  Yes, you can eran TPs but it's sloooooow.  And fellowships (forming a party) is a pain and you really need to make sure your fellow fellows know what they are doing.  I got to level 23 without dying, joined a fellowship for a dungeon and died almost immediately.  The housing system can leave you miles from where the action is so you'll probably end up buying and selling several homes.Try it! "
"Good game , if u have a friend to team up with it is really great but unless u pay u wont be able to go above lvl 50 or so. Still awesome though. Maybe i might add i am in luck and purchased a vip account which lastrs forever back in the days for ""ONLY"" 200€"
"Fun game, although you feel kinda left out if you don't pay money into the game. It's not impossible to progress without money, but the game askes for it a lot. It's kinda a fun game without money, but recommened playing with friends or else it gets boring fast.It has skill trees which is always fun in games. Archer is OP in 1v1's late game, I reccomened though!"
"A perfect game for people who enjoy Tolkien's fantasy world and are willing to engage themselves to an unique adventure through the Middle-Earth. Can be played alone or with friends depenging your own preferences - there aren't too many players on most servers but always enough to find someone to co-op with. I've spent already over 400 hours with this game and I'll probably find myself riding with my war-steed around the newly-updated regions for hundreds, if not thousands of hours."
The only MMORPG I keep returning to. Graphic might be a bit outdated but still the best game imo. It's LOTR world that follows books. Now the Mordor Area opened up so the story from the books stops there but the devs made up their own story of what happens in Mordor after destruction of Sauron and I love it.2 new areas opened around the lonely mountain
"I first starting playing this game in May-time, amassing a lot of hours before migrating onto the Steam version. I've enjoyed every moment of it, even with having to often play with low graphics settings due to a sub-par laptop. The immersion in the world of LotR is excellent, and it is very easy to believe that you are actually there rather than playing a game. Even more helpful for the immersion is a large roleplaying community, which is welcoming of beginners and experianced players alike. Shortly after starting the game, I was invited to a kinship (Guild) in game, which has proved to be one of the best part of the game, showcasing the hospitality and friendliness of the many LOTRO players. My one qualm perhaps, is that the combat for some classes can be somewhat jerky, but is more than made up by the beautiful in-game landscapesI would recommend this game to any fans of LotR wholeheartedly, and I think they are in fact missing out on a special part of the LotR community if they never play it"
Alright Lets Get Serious!Being a MMO this lives up to the hype of the description given. You can have fellowships just like in the 'Real-Life'. It has lots of Character customization which is not seen in the recent games.This game is GREAT when it florished in 2007. This game has real decent graphics for a game that is 10 years old. So here are the 'CONs' and 'PROs' of this game.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROs :~Game is free (not much need of DLCs or `pay to win' stuff)~Great Character physics on walk cycles~Servers are real stable~Might seem complicated TBH it's not~Easy to learn controls~Great fast communication with fellow players~Lots of customization on character to suit the `Quest'~Great time-killer~Great big 'Middle Earth' beautifully made worldCONs : ~The 'World-Character' physics is bad.~The Tutorial must be better~Hints are too long which makes reading a frustration~Some Quests are very badly discribed~The `Fight' ( battle ) against enemies are slower compared to games of this generation~Lots of information given right in the start making things so overwhelming.~The key mapping is so wide and not easy to switch between abilites~Game crashes at times when going throught the portals~Selection of different class does not impact the combat skills (such a bummer)~The map is not user-friendly takes a long time to get used to it~Game higly requires `Remastered Version'~Combat is easy no need of real gaming skills.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thats it for the review!Thanks for readingComment down further thoughts
"As you can see, I have almost 20 hours in this game. I heard about it from an old friend of mine who enjoyed it very much and we both love the LOTR universe.Why am I going to downvote this game? Let me tell you.Out of the 20 hours you see, I have spent 18 in the launcher trying to get this game working using every available source I could find. Worth the time? No.After the 5th reinstall, I had enough and created a virtual PC where I could play finally play.Now, after spending this much time trying to only set up the game, I was very dissapointed. The game was garbage and I felt like garbage too.♥♥♥♥ this game."
"I've played LOTRO for a pretty long time. This game has never been boring. You always have something to do. The game graphics are still pretty good for such an old game. AND IT IS FREE. It does cost you something, if you buy the expansions. But it will max cost you about... €100,- for almost everything. The community is active to, so there are always people you can talk to."
"Updated March 2018:  This game is now owned by Standing Stone Games.  They've added so much new content since I last played, so I may see how far I go this time around.+ Great level design and huge worlds that have actual content+ Story dedicated to Tolkien lore+ Decent character class selection and cooperative abilities+ Nice community- Dated graphics, derpy animations- Grind for free players (past level 32 you will need to start spending the LOTRO points you earn on further quest content)"
"I ""HIGHLY"" recommend this game it has such a vas class option going anywhere from Tank to Heal to a little of both. i personally love the  Lore Master Class the Minstrel Class and the Rune Keeper Class, these 3 classes are epic as a LM you can be virtualy unstoppable because you have the ability to summon a pet to your side to help you with your quest thru the story where as the Minstrel not only has has the power to do Major Dps but can Also heal now the down side of the Minstrel is you can do wither or but not both at the same time, the RK on the other hand also can do Major Dps and heal but unlike the Minstrel the RK can do both at the same time. The down side of the RK is you have to use real money to purchase it from the lotro store. Now if you are a tank you coud go with the gaurdian this Class has the upmost amount of Hp i think the most ive seen in HP is 21k at max rank this class is ment for group stile playing made to take all the damage while dealing lots of Dps, nwo if you like to help the group out and do alot of DPS then i recoment the Champion this is almost like the gaurdian but doesnt have as much HP this class is set more towards high amount of DPS with little dameage taken good for group still playing, if you are mre of a ranged player and not for the up close and personal then i recmend the hunter class it your usaual bow and sword class good for ranged DPS but in this game it has a major ability that everbody needs this ability is swift travel witch basically mean that you dont have to use a stable you will have a skill that will let you go straight to the desired location the last class this game has is for more a quite sneak around play this calss is the burglar this class uses more of trickster skills to throw the enemy.  this game is a well worth it game i again recomend it and i hop ethis helps you guys/girls out and enpires you to play this game, if you do decide to play this game and start to have problems or need help add Themusicguy that is my toons name and i will be happy to help"
"Lord of the Rings Online is a great game, if you are a fan of the franchise. the game follows an epic story line which is based on the books. in a decent DLC, all the classes have been revamped which unfortunately made the game too easy. for example, in the game i have a lvl 95 guardian which is a tank class. i have 28k morale and i soloed a Warband which is a type of mob that roams around the plains of rohan. this warband called ""bethan"" have just under 1m morale and i soloed her when before the undate i wouldnt of dreamed of doing it. this is not a reason why you shouldnt play the game though. the crafting on the game is actually very fun but can be a grind. also if you are looking for a PvP game then this one has PvMP where one side play as the free people and the others as wither Orcs, Uruks, Wargs, Spiders and Trolls. give it a try and as its free and if you like it then i seriously suggest you play for VIP as the bonuses you get from it are very good."
"I love the MMO experience, and have played a number of them over the past five years. LotRO is the only one I keep coming back to, not for it's production quality as it does lack in keeping up with the pack, but for it's excellent community, lore and dedication to Tolkien's Middle-Earth."
"Really fun to explore the world that resembles the most popular books ever. Crashes unexpectedly once in a while, but really its not that much of an inconvenience for me. Must mention that I am on a Mac, and that crashing does seem to be a lot less since the update. A lot more fun when playing with other people obviously, and it seems that Free to Play is only great up to about level 40ish. Going beyond that requires a subscription in order to have fun and avoid 'grinding.'"
"While this game is incredibly fun and addicting, there's just not enough people that play. As an avid LOTR fan, I love the game, but to me, it's lagging behind all the other games. This game, in short, has a very small community; you can't even find a dungeon unless you wait a half hour or more. I do, however, like the story aspect to it, as it follows the storyline as the books tell it and not how the movies tell it. It does not have all the features as the leading MMORPGs do, but it could definitely be a competitor if there was more time and effort put into advertising the game. Even if it doesn't have a ton of features compared to other MMORPGs, it is free to play, with the option of paying for expansions in-game. The free-to-play aspect is rarely seen in today's gaming world, but it is also very restricted. This game has a great potential and there is an immense amount of people who love the LOTR franchise as well as the related Hobbit franchise.Like I said earlier, this game is very addicting and has potential, but I'm not going to recommend it. My recommendation for if you want to find a good MMORPG is to look somewhere else. Yes, I'm going to say it; look towards World of Warcraft. It is much more addicting and has a much bigger community base than LOTRO. Also, Elder Scrolls Online has just been released for the PC and will soon be released for the PS4 and Xbox One. ESO has a lot of potential and should definitely be considered. Your opinion on LOTRO may be different from mine, so download it for FREE and give it a try."
"First off, i don't play this game through Steam. So my hours are not correct. I play this game since the launch in 2012, loved it and hated it at times. Many changes have been made to this game throughout the years, which is fine, but Turbine makes this game easier and easier with every update. In it's current state it's designed for the casual solo player who likes to spend 30 minutes a day questing, exploring or chatting with other people. There is almost no group play at all anymore. If you are looking for a MMO where you can raid and do instances with others, this is not the MMORPG for you anymore.If you like LOTR, and you just like to follow the story, this might be a good MMORPG for you.If you like roleplaying, this might be the MMORPG for you as there is 1 RP server and they sometimes do RP events.Also, note it's 'free'. But if you want to get to the level cap you will have to buy a whole lot of expansions and quest packs to get there, unless you want to kill millions of mobs to reach your goal.Oh, and the 'PvP' in this game is a joke. Very unbalanced and it's been like that since day 1. With every update the overpowered side changes, but never a way between overpowered and useless."
"I used to play this game A LOT (back in Shadow of Angmar days) and I witnessed the switch to F2P, which slowly started killing the game. Recently I installed it again just to check up on it and some friends I used to play with. The experience was rather traumatic. My kin (in the past one of the bigger kins on Eldar: Lorebreakers) merely a shadow of its former glory. People say it's difficult to get a party of 6 to do an instance (let alone the buggy raids). Turbine Points required wherever you go and click. Turbine and WB finally succeeded in butchering a great game it used to be. Such a shame."
"There are some great MMOs out there.....this is not one of them. This game initally is very good but rapidly it becomes quite annoying because you need to buy the DLC to continue the story line, any ""Help"" the game offers is piece meal and there little if any voice acting and its not so much as a Lord of the Rings MMORPG as a Lord of the Rings take on World of Warcraft.I love Lord of the Rings I really do. This I hate. And it gets better, now they add little helpful hints that (if you read between the lines) say ""HAHA Screw you, you wont be able to advance the story cause....PAYWALL!!!"" And they are not very subtle in the fact that they screw you over. They are in essence operating on the basis that there game is SO GOOD that every one would want to pay for the DLC. HAHA...no. The next time I start to feel a little masocistic I will play this game."
"this was once a great game but the skill tree conversion , cut the balls off any and all uniqueness your characters had , and basically mde it so that they were worthless and you had to start from scatch to have any character that was survivable ... Turbine made the same mistake everyone else is making ...Simplifying games for children to play and screwing over the adults who actually pay to have a challenging game"
"Would love to play but sadly, ""installing pre reqs"" says no, what a waste took like 4 hours to download only to be stumped on the launcher, whats more not even a problem only i am having apparently lots of people have this same issue and it still hasnt been fixed or at least hinted at a patch, nice work turbine. clap clap...."
"Honestly, it's not particularly worth your time. From the get go, the game lets you know that you're not really going to go too far if you're not spending money. While it's free to play, the free content is straight up limited, and the paid content is all over the place. It's practically a demo, giving you some extremely boring areas to explore and quest in, and teasing you with the paid content. This would be all well and good, but the paid content is also lackluster. To get the full experience, you have to both subscribe, and deal with a metric tonne of microtransactions. And if that's not all, the gameplay somehow manages to be more boring than World of Warcraft's."
"I, unfortunately, can not recommend LOTRO.  I really want to, but can't.  It's lots of fun, don't get me wrong, especially when played with a few friends.  But the hamhanded attempts to wring money out of the game by Turbine will be kicking the back of your seat the whole way.Look, I understand that a Free to Play game still has to make some money for upkeep costs and whatnot, but NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THE ORIGINAL LEVEL CAP FROM 7 YEARS AGO IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.If you end up playing you will find out you can reach level 35-40, depending on how much grind you do.  The original level cap was 50.Again, I'm not saying that they should give away the expansions, thats what makes all the long term money, but not letting players reach the original base level cap, and without telling them in advance, is honestly a terrible thing to do.It has has left a bad taste in my mouth that will likely be my last inpression of this once fun game.I guess if I had to sum this up it would be...Fun, but don't let the ""Free to Play"" tagline fool you.  In order to play more than 1/3rd of the game you have to sink close to 70 bucks into it for expansion and quest packs."
"To start off, Im recommending people to LOOK at the game, and not as much as, this is a fantastic game!! Really, this game is huge, vast, and will let you have hundreds of hours of playing time....trying to figure it out. While it is a very good MMORPG, it has its ups and downs. Let me name the ups and downs of the game and then you'll see the issue's.Ups: Great graphics, nice world, lots of towns all different and unique in some way. Crafting, class's, Ive seen some players look like knights, on a horseback. really feels like a Medieval England world. Sadly no castle's round Bree. Chatting is nice. Filter blocks bad stuff while it lets good stuff through. The looting system is one-of-a-kind, PvP, PvE, and you can even try out the Monster Play for a change of pace. The PvP is nice, and the PvE is also gonna be a critical role as you progress.If your the type that enjoys getting online, making online friends, joining groups, battling monsters, players, exploring different landscapes, and socializing, your probably thinking, whats the issue's? This sounds FANTASTIC!! Well let me now show you the downs of the game.Downs: Too much lag. Especially going into the towns. And towns are where your gonna buy n sell, meet the characters to progress through the story, and mail letters to players. Ive uninstalled two games to see if it would help. It helped, but still a little laggy. Next, the class videos, where it shows what each class is like, is SOO laggy, and usually in some battle/land area where your not gonna be for a long time. Plus it dont show you what weapons you can and cant have. So, you choose a class that sounds good. You complete the tutorial, and are ready to equip that shield you got awhile back. Oh wait, you cant cause its not available for your class. Wouldv'e been nice to know that ahead of time. And weapons aint the only thing lacking instructions. You get some dye to change your armour's colors. You can spend real money for extra amounts. Oh wait, it never said how to use it exactly. But they'll gladly let you spend money on it. How bout a horse? It says visit some guy in Bree-land for a starter horse. But wait! Whats this? No instructions where to find this random guy in a 10+ mile land? And without a horse, it takes ALOT LONGER to get anywhere. Oh and real money is needed to buy a riding trait. Take a LONG time to earn the points to buy the trait. Oh and some lands cost money to unlock.Ive found an active server on my fourth try. Its called Gladden. An active server will be important. According to some players I met in a kinship, they say level 40-50 is where your gonna have to spend some money to progress. I cant say thats true for certain however. By now, I'd say its safe to say, ""free to play"" needs a fine print saying ""until a certain point"" though it still leaves alot to run around and see...until it gets boring. My final overall thought: look at game, find an active server(Gladden) and spend hundreds of hours trying to figure it out. If you figure it out, and got money, you have hundreds of hours to look forward to. If not, hundreds of hours trying to figure it out down the drain. Oh and dont get discouraged when the usual ""new player bug"" pops up 45 seconds into the game. Just relog. To me, feels like alot of potential going down the drain.REVIEW UPDATE: It seems LOTRO has a rather dedicated and very loyal following of players, judging by the other reviews. However, when they say it still has an ""active community"" they either mean seeing no new players, every once and awhile some chat through the world chat box, seeing 2 players on through the week, with one of the 2 being AFK(Away From Keyboard) and then seeing a ""crowd"" of 4-7 over the weekend, means ""active to them. It  dont sound exactly ""active"" to me. Though on Gladden I have seen lots of new players, and lots of chat through the world chat. Recently, however, even Gladden was rather player-less, but world chat filled. Some places even on Gladden are quiet as a grave. Unless of course they've all gone to another, far-off region where new players needing help wont get to. Or they are all sitting on the LOTRO official website on there forums/community or something like that. I cant say for sure. The game is ""ancient"" by MMO standards, and even the movies have been out awhile, with one last final movie to look forward to. Reason I even out the ""thumbs up"" sign was in the hope maybe it'd encourage new players to help clarify the confusion this game creates within itself."
"If you're not a devour fan on LOTR, then i dont think you will enjoy it.The graphics and animatiosn are dated but rumoured to be getting an upgrade soon.The quests are soul destroying in how boring they are, once every 500 quests or so you get a good one.They're alos tailored towards buying mithril coins, otherwie you have to travel for miles to hand in a quest.No one uses the dungeon finder, because they think no one uses it, its really stupid.But i love the exploration and i love lotr so i tolerate it. "
"Some guy asked me if Lotro was a virus....well it is. Once it takes its hold on you, it will spread to every last cell in your body and reprogramm your DNA to produce more virus' to infect more of your cells. So far it has taken 365 billion of my cells away."
"I consider LOTRO one of the very best MMORPGs. The classes are interesting, the quest texts and lore are actually worth reading, the landscape has a quaint, pleasant, feel to it, and the payment model is quite flexible."
i recommend playing this game for freeif you like it.. buy the starter pack or something simple like the samwise starter pack.  They are under 5 to 14$it will be soloish tell you hit higher levels... then you can buy time for VIP content or spend money on Helms deep for VIP steam... they are not worried because you have to drop like 200$ dollars... to get the full game without paying per monthvip for 2 years time-monthly is like 250$ dollars ...so... depends what you are going to do.
"This game is awsome, id recommend it entirely.Well let me start wirh this,  They are expansions and eventually youll have to pay for expansions to continue. Dont let this throw you off though youll have about 50 levels to decide if you want to buy or not. :)The Lore is amazing. If you are a lord of rings fan, then trust me the story is good, i dont know how to explain it....  it angles with the story and you meet important characters, yet... it has its own story.Next, there is pvp. Im not sure if its pay to win. But you do have to pay money for the expansions to become level 100. (which is top level), BUT there is a monster mode, where you play orcs in the pvp.( you start with one damage dealer class, to get more you have to pay for more),    You have to take forts for your side (bad guys and good guys) I think it is realy fun, but it requires teamwork  in the you literally cant solo it without dying. Now i played one server and its not the most active pvp ever, its a freeroam pvp, so sometimes there is alot, other times there isnt.Next is quests, Some are intersting and some are boring. Not much to say that hasnt been said :)Deeds, deeds are achivements, they can give you special boosts, currency, or turbine points (more on that later) they are a little tedious and it takes patience and some grinding skills to complete.turbine points, they are the premium currency and they can be bought. Or you can earn them in small amounts from deeds and a few quests. They are used for account upgrades and  many other useful stuff, now they can be used to buy almost everything, including expansions. So it is possible to play the whole game withought paying a cent, BUT it requires alot of grinding, to the point where you may as well buy them.Mounts, you gotta love them, but you gotta grind for them, this part sucks, but you have to grind for turbine points to get a riding permit to buy a mount. I did it though without paying nothing. Heres a tip, do abunch of deeds while you are in a area, or at least do part of it, so you can save a lot of backtracking. I love my mount and i got a sense of achievment when i bought mine. :)   Also you need to be level 20 to buy one :) :) :) :)This game is awsome, LOADS of content to explore. I suggest downloading it right away and seeing for yourself how awsome it is. I mean come on its free ;).By the way im level 20. :)Edit:I have paied money for turbine points to buy some stuff. I think it was worth it, i bought a character slot and money bag upgrade. (see below)Also forgot to mention you have limited in game currency space ( not turbine points) but this can also be avoided by spending turbine points. I hope to see in the game. Happy Hunting! :)"
"Playing as a human captain who's companion does nothing other than carry around my banner for me. This game is awesome. There's so much content in here, so much lore- this game is old, but they are still releasing content in 2018. They never stopped releasing content. So much stuff to do. With the new middle earth tv series coming out on Amazon, this game is going to get a jump in players. The show will give the game developers a lot more reasons to make content, hopefully they can tie the two together. Feel free to add me & join the crickhollow server in NA"
"Has gone WAY downhill in recent months. Was  sorta tolerant of their pay 4 content structure since I LOVED the series and the epic storyline so much. It was also still fun to play so it wasn't all bad. However, they released the Helms Deep update. It was an utter disaster. The classes were entirely revamped and pretty much all utility was stripped away. Before you could have some mixed skills and do well. Now though, you are made to play exactly how Turbine WANTS you to play. There is no balanced classes or multi-tasking. If  you tank, your DPS was so far in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you needed a dps with you to take down the enemy. If you were DPS of any kind, you had zero defensive skills and would die almost immediately. If you're a healer, you better find a group and stick with it because your DPS AND defense will leave you bleeding and dead. This would have been acceptable, if Turbine's response to the consumer's want to roll back the disasterous update was not just a general ""♥♥♥♥ you"""
"I tried this game years ago and only played the free areas. It was patronisingly easy and dull at the beginning but it got better as it went on. When I'd finished all the free areas and hit the currency cap, I moved on to a different game. I always remembered how much I enjoyed it though and recently I bought the expansion packs during a sale. It's much more enjoyable paying for access rather than grinding for Turbine Points. With the expansion areas unlocked, it's a lot easier to get TP too. After a couple of quest pack purchases, the whole game can be unlocked painlessly through regular play."
"My review is on behalf on how end game is right now and the current state of Lotro. If you enjoy a game that runs extremely well with low stutter this game is nothing but the opposite. No matter where you are, you stutter around like it’s the ice level of Mario and even with the highest end computer, its hard to get decent FPS with the games horrible optimization. Looking at some pros: Lotro has amazing story, some of the best story in any MMORPG i've ever played. And the world of Middle Earth is breathtaking. I have collected so many screenshots while leveling from 1-115. The creativity of each zone while staying true to the book is astonishing. But thats about it, The gameplay is extremelyslow and repetitive. PvE or PvP content is rarely seen. And the world feels extremely empty with all players at max level and in the newest zones. If you enjoy a good single player story game then you will enjoy the leveling experience as I did, but there’s not much of a social part of the game unless you join an “active” kinship. I’ve played this game for around 4 years with 1,500 hours, and while a lot of the hours were enjoyable. It is still an amazing game that always seems to bring me back. If you love middle earth lore, the world, and the people, Than this is your game. If you are looking for an MMORPG with amazing content and gameplay, I would reccomend ESO, WoW, or BDO."
"Nice game, potraying LOTR lore, however the leveling is often boring, and as F2P the game becomes unplayable around level 30.Having said that, I know several friends who have subscribed to the game, and really enjoy it - my advice is, go for it if you don't mind the fees, if you are looking for a F2P, dont touch it.P.S. Yes, I am aware of the deeds and that they were recently made ""easier"" to achieve and thus purchase more content, but its still an icerdible boring grind and is unsustainable, especially as players need to buy a LOT of content in addition to quests, such as mount and increased wealth cap - which makes it better than swtor somewhat, but it will still give you only about 5-6 zones with minimal changes should you play different race/character later on."
"a very fun game to play with a group. you can live among some of your favorite legends and play music in bands, slay monsters, do quests, etc. the community is typically a nice one and you have the option to pay for additional content."
"Lord of the Rings Online is a great balance between an MMORPG and a Free2Play game. The storyline is truly epic, the game mechanics are finely tuned and you can chose to play in any style you desire. Definitely a AAA title worth checking out!"
"play this game since the beginning...since the SSG Company turns this game more and more to a shop-to-play game , i dont recommend this game to anyone till they change their policy (and i dont think they will)....avarice for the win...so sad...."
"Lord of the Rings Online is the epitome of the MMORPG genre's success. With a whole variety of quests and a new system dedicated to absolute control over how you build your character you can play the same class multiple times and each time is a new experience. Lore-accurate and immensely immersive, Turbine has truly created an epic to do justice to Tolkein's work. Unlike most other MMORPGs, the whole gaming experience is suitable for both the solo and group player. Endgame is just as fun playing alone as it is in a group and you are not forced into pigeonholed quests or raid runs if you don't want to play that way in order to access good endgame gear. A unique and enjoyable PVP experience playing as either your character or creating an evil character to challenge the Free Peoples means that you can never get bored of this game. Try it risk-free and money-free today. You will not regret it!"
Product received for free1:controls are not fixed and got trouble moving arround and interacting...2:the game from such title as is lotr demands entirely newly based engines like one used in shodow of mordor instead of one made in 2007 when gaming Industries were still underdeveloped...
"If you like Lord of the Rings and the MMORPG games, it's your game. Very funny, although you have to buy expansion packs, you can get Turbine Points completing achievements in the game. With patience you can buy the pack quest and expansion packs."
Finished tutorial. Forgot about the game for several months. Decided to play again. Restarted because I forgot everything. Played tutorial again. Finished tutorial. Forgot about the game for several months. 7.3453/10 would play 7.7 hours of tutorials again
"Completely F2P and definitely worth a shot. Played it for a while, it's a lovely game but I'm not too sure if it's actually worth a monthly subscription. If I remember it right you can become a VIP for like 8 bucks a month, which is cheaper than WoW. The game also has an in-game store in which you can buy all sorts of lovely stuff with Turbine points. You can either earn Turbine points by doing tasks in-game, or if you're lazy you can buy them with money. Anyway, this is an awesome game."
"I enjoy this game. I always loved the novels, and this filled out the LOTR stories. Play it,!Also, you can earn Turbine points in game, which can then be used to buy the extra content. You never have to pay money if you don't want to."
"Well worth the money for the quest packs but, playable for free to players. After about ten hours you'll be hooked on this game. I can say looking back that it has died out considerably because of a dwindling fanbase I can say that as a level 36 wizard(lore master) that the dungon raids are by far the more exciting things about this game; The high difficulty if a nice break from all the questing."
"Very Fun MMO. For any Lord of the Rings fan, I recommend this title. While it says it is free to play, if you are looking to really get into the game, expect to fork over the money."
"I recommend this mmorpg to all who like classic role playing environment and a mature, serious style. I play lotro slow and not hard core at all so for me the environment and the storyline is important. Technically the graphics is not the latest but the environment is somehow cosy and neat. That said the design of the races are totally dead and stiff. Since I have not reached end game yet I can not tell how good it scales. So for me lotro works well as a relaxing mmorpg."
"This is an excellent game, I've put countless hours into it before it was availiable on steam, and I'll put a countless number of more hours into it now that it is on steam.First impressions are not something to look at to appreciate this game, once your done with the rediculous opening quests and reach level 20, that where the real fun begins."
"This is one of the best mmorpgs I have ever played.I have played this game for hundreds and hundres of hours (outside steam), and also played WoW, RIFT, SWTOR, Tera and before that Ragnarok, Vanguard, EQ1 and DaoC. But still I keep returning to this game, even though some options cost real money, I dont find that a problem because all the main features are free, if you dont pay real money you wont have a less fun experience. For instance they made the Lore-master class free, which is my favorite class so I was excited to see this happen.Also the movie references are lovely, If you are a fan of the LotR you love the characters you gonna find in this game. "
It's overall a nice game but I didn't enjoy it as much cause I was playing it alone :)I mean none of my friends play it so it was kind of dullbut the cool part would be playing in Middle Earth
"Very fun game with a devotion to the LOTR lore. It can be a bit tedious at times, but such is the reality of MMORPG's.A lot of people complain about the community nowadays. But as long as you find the right Kinship, you will find people are extremely helpful.I will admit I am now bored if not done with the game. But that wasn't before I got over 200 hours out of it. It's not perfect, but if you like Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings, and you also like MMORPG's, I'm surprised if this game isn't already in your library. If it isn't, click the ""Play Game"" button."
"Well i should say something about this game but i have no reasonable words for it, its deffinitely great game with very detailed graphics but i always miss there something, one of main cons is need of paying for many things which are normally unseparable part of game, now i mean paying for quests after level 30, if it would be for some special quests i dont mind, something is just special but after 30? Yeah, its not so expensive but still only advertisments and in-game errors like unfunctional in-game store, its something unpleasant....Other thing is that f2p players have only 2 character slots, but its hard to put to pros or cons, lets leave it between, its good that f2p has a chance to play for more than 1 toon, but from other side its only 2, some people love crafting and in this game is great system of it, everyone can make very good armor or weapons but still needs more than 2 toons to be not addicted to auctions or other sources of equipment and other items....To say something as pros, there are really great places for just enjoying of that beautiful scenery of Middle-earth, large amount of weapons and enemies, also hobbies and other things like smoking weed (which made me laughing, its very good idea from author and same from creators of the game: )) or musical instruments....And one really large pros: outfits, its great because it makes player happy to see his toon, without this system there would be so many ugly toons because of bad looking armor, with this there disapear problems with chosing between usable and good looking, great work if i can say it: )And about paying again, i understand that everyone needs money especially when team of people wants to make something enjoyable for other people like this amazing game which leads players through Middle-earth, i admire it also because iam a great fan of Lotr books and movies. So i dont pressure to anyone, i only said what i like and dislike: )Yeah and something from in-game expirience, i played as Lore-Master (LM), Hunter, Champion and Guardian, if i can say, the best (in case of fun) are Hunter and then Lore-Master, Champion is perfect in PvE but in duels with other players i have the best expirience with LM, Hunter is great in case of fast killing, teleports and has lots of hp, but he loses his powers quickly so i can recommend to fellowship Hunter with Lore-Master as his powersource when fights are long and other help is not avaliable at the moment, then for tanking Guardian is great, he does low amount of damage but his power is hidden in high amount of hp, he stands many attacks and when there is also Champion or Captain, damage is large and Captain can heal well.... Then i like deeds, sometimes hard to do but great way to earn points for in-game store.So its something from me about this game, as you can see, i can totally recommend it but like always, nothing is perfect:) "
"This game is great game. Sure there are bugs in the game still but the gameplay itself is great. There is a lot of content to do. And if you wanna do deeding, well it will take awhile of course. But it's a fair trade atleast. sub this game is very good idea if you are up for it. Or you just buy the expensions which would be quad pack and the helms deep one. Don't buy the triple pack here in the store.There is of course pvp, but it's not main of the game excatly. Since the biggest part is pve or raiding and such. But there will be more new content in the future.The things you can do as free to play player. you can go to cap level which lvl 95. Get your epic gear. and many other things.even use the mounted combat. Lots of features.Just give it a try i am pretty sure you going like it."
Yes i know i didnt havent put alot of hours into the game cause i downloaded it not long ago. This game is amazing. This game is one of the best mmorpg i have ever played. Its full of adventure and the community is so friendly not hostile. Ill definitely recommend this game for someone who is looking for an enjoyable mmo.
"It is not often I get lost in a game like I did with Lord Of The Rings. Everything about this game screams quality and adventure. While GameCompany Co. hasn't exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. A much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system that's amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. Truly a masterpiece."
"Don't install from Steam.  Go to Standing Stone Games and download from their site.  the game store in the Steam version DOES NOT WORK.You cannot buy anything in game, and you can't activate your pay to play account from the in game store on the Steam version.All in all, just down load it from the developers site.With that said:The game is fantastic, great story and the quests are well done.  Micro-transactions suck and are a bit expencive, but you can earn LOTRO points while playing so you can up-grade your account simply by playing the game.VIP is worth the money (pay-to-play) more so then almost anyother MMO out there.This is the game that made me quit WoW, because it's just better."
"My dear frodo...The Lord of the RingsThe Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume of The Lord of the Rings, begins with Bilbo's ""eleventy-first"" (111th) birthday (on 22 September), 60 years after the beginning of The Hobbit. The main protagonist of the novel is Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's kinsman, who celebrates his 33rd birthday and legally comes of age on the same day.In T.A. 2989 (S.R. 1389), Bilbo, a lifelong bachelor, adopted Frodo, the orphaned son of his first cousin Primula Brandybuck and his second cousin Drogo Baggins, and made him his heir. Though Frodo was actually ""his first and second cousin once removed either way"",[1] the two regarded each other as uncle and nephew.All this time Bilbo had kept his magic ring, with no idea of its significance, using it mostly to hide from his obnoxious cousins, the Sackville-Bagginses, when they came to visit. Gandalf's investigations revealed it to be the One Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron. The Ring had prolonged Bilbo's life beyond the normal hobbit span, and at 111 he still looked 50. While the Ring did not initially corrupt him as it had its previous owners, it was beginning to affect him; over the years, it had begun to prey on his mind when out of his sight, and he lost sleep and felt ""stretched out and thin"",[2] as he said to Gandalf.On the night of his and Frodo's birthdays, Bilbo announced his intent to turn his home and estate over to Frodo, put on the Ring and vanished from sight. As Bilbo prepared finally to leave the house, he reacted with panic and suspicion when Gandalf tried to persuade him to leave the Ring with Frodo. Bilbo refused to give up the Ring, referring to it as his ""precious"" – just as Gollum had in The Hobbit. Gandalf lost his temper with his old friend, talking some sense into him. Bilbo admitted he would have liked to be rid of the Ring, and he left it behind, becoming the first person to do so voluntarily. He left the Shire that night, and was never seen in Hobbiton again.His earlier adventure, his eccentric habits as a hobbit, and his sudden disappearance lead to the enduring figure of ""Mad Baggins"" in hobbit folklore, who disappeared with a flash and a bang and returned with gold and jewels.Freed of the Ring's power over his senses, Bilbo travelled to Rivendell, where for the next 17 years he lived a pleasant life of retirement: eating, sleeping, writing poetry, and working on his memoirs, There and Back Again, known to us as The Hobbit. He became a scholar of Elven lore, leaving behind the Translations from the Elvish, which forms the basis of what is known to us as The Silmarillion.When Frodo and the other Hobbits stopped in Rivendell on their quest to destroy the Ring, Bilbo was still alive but now visibly aged, the years having caught up with him after he surrendered the Ring. Upon seeing the Ring again, he suddenly tried to take it from Frodo; he returned to his senses when a terrified Frodo backed away, and he broke down in tears, apologizing for bringing the burden of the Ring onto Frodo.After the quest to destroy the Ring was fulfilled in The Return of the King, Gandalf and the four Hobbits visited Rivendell on their way back to the Shire and found Bilbo still living there. He gave Frodo a set of manuscripts that later became Translations from the Elvish, and also gave Samwise Gamgee a small bag of gold that represented the last of his share from Smaug's vast hoard. Two years later Bilbo accompanied Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Frodo to the Grey Havens, there to take ship for Tol Eressëa across the sea, on 29 September, T.A. 3021. He had already celebrated his 131st birthday by this time, surpassing the Old Took by one year and becoming the oldest living Hobbit ever in Middle-earth. (The average life expectancy of hobbits who survive to adulthood is about 100 years.) "
This is a game that you need a fellowship if you dont no what that is it's a group of people that do big quests. You have to chosse a class and a race that you would like to play as in the world of middle-earth. Out of 10 i would give this game a 9. Give it a go and click the play game button thanks for reading.
"I do think that the game is good but it does have its flaws here and there like the fact that if you're not in a dungeon (I don't know I haven't gotten THAT far into the game) some players can come into the area you're in and straight up steal your kills and get the XP YOU'RE fighting for! I only think that's a minor flaw, though. While the game certainly isn't perfect I still think it's fun. I definitly recommend that you play this game."
"The 160 hours on record here are a joke, since I mostly played through the actual client way before Steam was even a thing.This is an amazing game for many reasons, and one of my all-time favourites. This is interesting since I have never actually completed the final content of any tier, I just have too much fun playing older content and exploring the areas to really powerlevel anything. NOTE: I bought the ""lifetime subscription"" which was available at launch. This option has since been discontinued, so I am unable to comment on the free version of the game.So, here are the pros and cons from a ""hard-core casual MMO gamer"":+Area designFrom the lush hills of the shire, through the lightless reaches of Khazad Dum, to the windswept steppes of Gondor, this game features as many nooks and crannies as the developers could think of. Each area has something that makes it unique, and I had a ton of fun exploring each of them. For instance, my first character spent 5 more levels than he needed to in Moria, yet I still feel that I could go back and explore it more.+Music ScoreVery few games are able to conveigh emotions through music well, but this game takes it to a whole new level. Haunting frost wastes, creepy forests, homely taverns or busy towns, the music and background sounds are still impressive even after I listened to them so many hours spent in these places. I cannot speak for all areas of course, but the sound team certainly knows what they are doing.+ReputationMiddle Earth isn't heavily populated, so the few settlements outside of places like Bree or The Shire can really use a helping hand. And unlike in many games I have played, you really feel that the people are grateful for your heroic service. Every faction has crafting recipes, weapon designs and vanity items to earn. You even get discounts on travelling within their realms. They also tend to change their dialogue when they see you. Aside from the direct reputation, your character also earns ""virtues"", which are equippable buffs you earn by being helpful to people you encounter in your travels or exploring the lands of Middle Earth.+CraftingThis is always a big selling point for the in any MMO, and LOTRO does it amazingly well. Every profession is useful to every character (although some are more useful to a particular class than others), but you don't feel you NEED to take up a certain vocation in order to play your class properly. I especially like the Farmer. They can not only grow produce needed by cooks, but also pipe weed which has no purpose other than role-playing and cosmetics.+Role-PlayingWhile obviously not able to rival ""true"" role-playing games, this game comes as close as I think you can be without sacrificing essential game-play elements. There are a myriad of emotes, many of the cool ones are earnable. You have the ability to set cosmetic outfits, and you can share cool item designs between all your characters even if the stats of that item are lousy. Dyes can be crafted by a profession and applied to almost everything except your weapons. The bard class goes one step further in combining the well-known ""supporter with song"" archetype with a fully integrated music playing minigame to entertain your fellows, and can teach other classes how to play the many instruments that are found in-game.Going beyond pure in-game mechanics, there are even role-play dedicated groups you can join in many different languages online.-Free to play ... not reallyThe store page sais free-to-play, but it is really free to download. What you get for free is basically a demo. Keep in mind that this used to be a pure subscription based game, just like World of Warcraft. While I myself never actually had to play through the game without a VIP account (what the subscription is now), I know a few things from conversations on forums and in-game. The demo includes the starting zone of your race as well as Bree-lands, the main levelling area for characters around 20. EVERYTHING beyond this point must be purchased. Aside from content, you can also purchase almost everything that your character can unlock, but most of it can be done through normal gameplay, mostly by completing achievements. My recommendation would be to play the game for a bit until you are around level 20, and then, if you still like it, become a VIP. The devs REALLY want you to become a VIP, and from what I am able to tell this is a good bargain. But, if you are low on money, maybe browse the website and see if the various deals, packages or whatever are worth it to you. I wish they would just release a demo and make the rest pay-to-play, the current forest of pay-for-it or play-to-unlock-it descisions is really not fun.-Very grindyThis is a selling point for me, but it has become less popular in gaming. While you CAN unlock everything with real money, you really aren't going to be able to unlock your characters' true potential with money unless you have literally nothing better to do. Most of your character progression will be a hard-fought battle with millions of dead orcs, Uruks, spiders, wargs, and whatever else the game decides to throw at you. And if you just powerlevel past all the areas, your character will come out significantly weaker than someone who spent the time to get there slowly.Do you hate grinding with a passion? Hands off this game!-GraphicsThe graphics engine is as old as the game. There were a few updates, but the look is still the same. That maintains the old-school feeling of the game which is a good thing, but this may turn many people off when you compare it to clearly superior graphics engines used in games like Archage or Elder Scrolls Online. What this old-but-gold engine does well is artistic drawings on paintings and wall-hangings (some of the actual art in this game is truly amazing) and vast, sweeping landscapes. Since it is rather old, the areas tend to look very good even on low-end machines. What the engine does not do well at all is small details, which tend to be edgy and don't fit well. It also fails majorly with the hit boxes of terrain. The characters in-game often float above the scenery, you run into invisible walls or get stuck in midair (this doesn't happen often, but it is really annoying when mounted.) I love this rough-around-the-edges look the game has, but it isn't really a selling point in the days of Unity.So, finally, I would recommend this game if you: Love Lord of the Rings Love exploring many different lovingly crafted zones Enjoy actually playing a character instead of a spreadsheet Don't mind dated but still impressive graphicsI wouldn't get this game if you: Want to have balanced and well-tuned PVP Think the main point of MMOs is raiding and everything else takes a back seat Always need to have the most cutting edge graphics in your games hate slow progress through many different grindy areas "
"I recommend this game if and only if you play with MORE than 1 person. DO NOT PLAY ALONE, it gets boring EXTREMELY quick if you do. I have played for about 15 hours total in the range of 2 months thats how boring it got. It is worth a try though. I rate it a 67/100"
"i know this is a free to play, but its really not worth it... you start with a 2h long boring tutorial in which you can examine all the buggs, laggs that often happen. plus, this game is free but if you really want to play, dont go on an adventure without a credit card because this game is built to make money. comon, i mean they sell quest ! quests ! why, isnt it a free game ^ that is lame. i pleyd for about 5h the i deleted it, i suggest you dont even loose your time cause its a 17 GB game"
"this game is trully amazing and very fun and very smooth gameplay much better than several others i tried, plus being a fan of the lord of the rings saga this game gives it true justice i highly recommend this to everyone who loves good adventure and desires to fight along side with friends and family."
"After playing thousands of hours on this game, before I found steam, I enjoyed it a little too much. Early content was AWESOME, armor could have been a bit better ofcourse but one feature caught my eye over it all. The wardrobe system. Yes my dream feature in a game. Covering up the hideous lower level armor with some fancy high level gear. The ultimate Role Players dream. But as time dragged on the content began to get more and more dry. After Isenguard I found that the game wasn't the beautiful creation it was years before, now it is just as repetive as pong. R.I.P LOTRO."
"Maybe its amazing,, Maybe it sucks.. Nobody knows because i cant even get INTO the game! I hit play aand nothing. Several months ago i downloaded it after years of not playing it. And what happend ? Camera was broken to hell.. It got me so angry i have uninstalled it. I downloaded it again yesterday to check how things are now.. Who knows ?? I cant get into the game. GREAT!"
"Absolutely Terrible Game!Firstly, the controls are completely horrbile to work with, which makes the game worse.Secondly, I would say that you can't turn Middle Earth into a MMO because it will become a disaster (like the game I'm currently reviewing). And finally, the maps and upgrades are ridculous. Also, I cannot comprehend how stupid some of the quests are within  the game!. In conclusion, I would say that the game is a terrible disaster and has completely shamed the other Lord of the Rings games, books and movies.1/10Definately wouldn't play again, even if the fate of Middle Earth depended on it!"
It was very good and fun although over time it got repetitive and boring still its fun to go on and play with friends but by yourself not all that fun very cool aspects love how big the world is and the world design its amazing overall a pretty good game im.
"Used to play this game 24/7 , have about 3 months total online time on my alts . Since the Isengard expansion and beyond + the big overhaul of skills , and 90% of the player base dropped etc,  i just cant feel the joy in the game anymore . The devs where focusing on things that was not relevant , like giving moria/bree a cosmetic makeover when the recent expansion had tons of bugs needed to be fixed , events in game was just like the last years event (except from lacking players) and on and on . Still love my memories of the game , but it´s not at all what it used to be ."
*playing as an elf* *250 or so hobbits wearing nothing surronds me* *I get shanked to death from the Hobbit Horde*                              10/10 would get Rekt by Horde of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hobbits again.
"This game is a shell of it's former self. It was once great, even better before free to play, or so I've heard. The quest packs and expansions were completely understandable, as they have to make money somehow. They screwed it all over though. They want you to pay for everything.I started hating it when it recently tried to copy everything WoW did. They completely rebuilt the game. I loved it, absolutely loved it. Why did they ruin it, you ask? They wanted more money. MORE money. They figured if they changed everything and made it like WoW that people would come over and play it. Who thinks that? People like new things, not old, recycled gameplay and mechanics. Worst of all, you can just buy your way through the game. Why must companies insist on doing this crap?Just like WoW, this game is going to kill itself. Don't play it. It was much better before they screwed all the people who played it before. This game was awesome, but not anymore."
WHERE is the NEXT LOTR MMO? Why is there no graphical update to keep this alive? It is painful inthis state. DATED AND EMPTY like GUILD WARS 1 & 2... The entire point of an MMO is to remove the restriction of SHELF LIFE that one time purchase games are locked into... So many awesome games left to whither and die for no good reason...
"I asked around for good tips for playing as a creep.Someone said the game had a component called System 32 that blocked features and that I should delete it.Suffice to say, it worked like a charm."
it's good if you want to play some sort of good games in bucket with sandwitch witch witch isn't very vary vury good girls are always nice to dogs in sexy tops of some sort well don't you just love to like me to like something that someone likes?
"it takes sooooooooooooooooo long to download and it has been a day since i got it so i im not even sure i want to play it anymore and it looked like so much fun before, i dident think a online game would take so long. you know what screw it im done waiting for it. DO NOT GET IT LISTEN TO ME SAVE YOURSELFS  BEFORE YOU WASTE TIME THAT YOU WILL NEVER EVER EVER  EVER GET BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
You have to buy:RaidsQuestsDungeonsClassesServersSeveral expansions which are all $20-$50Whilst coping with a 12-year-old engine that provides a neverending list of gamebreaking bugs and issues. It's just not worth the trouble and it's easily the most P2W western MMO.
"I have sunk 1000's of hours in this game on and off steam, I know I clicked ""not reccomended"" if thats enough for you then stop reading, but I had sunk a large portion of my life into this game, and I would like you all to know why.this game has all the standard features of a MMO and a RPG that many of you are fermilur with, over the years turbine as it was released areas of middle earth slowly, building into a HUGE game area, and with good graphics at the time I really did take time out to ""smell the roses"" some of the sceanery was lush and full, even in dark angmar the view was delisously dismal as you would expect.many of the games features have been changed/removed/added/tweeked over the years and now its with standing stone games I doubt that will stop, its a good gombat RNG and nice boss fights (prepare for lag with large partys) with some nice rewards too, its a compleate middle earth world where you can really go almost anywhere, if you want to walk from bilbos home in the shire and travel to rivendell and see the elves, its all there and you can do that, the main travel system here is mounts (horses) and you can get a basic one fairly easy.the currency is lotro points (formaly TP) which can be bought with cash, but this is really only a shortcut, if you start with a free account you can earn points and slowly unlock the game, but will take 100's of hours 7.99 GBP can do in 5 min, it is reccomended to pay for one month, get all the char you want to lvl 20 so their all unlocked in trates/virtues and you can end your sub if you wish, this will support the game and save you aggro.unfortunatly the game is now dated with just playbae graphics for me, and they seam to not care about steam client crashing or not launching properly, so you need to start manually, the in game help/support/shop is all quite laughable, I have the shop down on my game for 3 months and was never responded from GM's, sometimes store bought items duplicated, taking twice the points for two items, and many items can only be used once, so I went into a 2 week argument with support, I did not get my points back.but the game has alot to offer even now, i'm trying not to sound to ratty against the game but there is a bug bare that really made me move away from this game, its the PVP side, there is only a small part of the game that is set aside for pvp players, you can be a monster if you pay your sub, of you can play as a free people if you use point for a time access (normally 1 hour and expires if not logged on) this is a really cruel and inhospitable place, I spent lots of time recieving abuse from either side, either I was a suspected spy, or I was leaching, yes I was a healer, guess what I do, :-)so I have decided to let this game go quietly into the distance, I have had many good gaming times with lotro, I trasure them all, but its too elitist now, you either have people trying becouse its free, or long time veterans who are rude and obnoxsuis, but not all, I have come accross many ""happy to help"" people, a big thank you to all of you.still a little life left if you want to try it."
"I'm going to be charitable and say this game is aimed at fans of LotR rather than gamers. Personally I found it to be a painful experience, and one I won't be repeating any time soon."
"Decent game with some major problems,  1.  Don't think becoming a subscriber does little more than give you a few MINOR perks and a little extra baggage space, Most things you are going to be spending real world cash to do, such as unlocking playable characters, etc. etc. as well as locked out of using World chat to get help when players will need it most, (I can understand on free accounts to limit spam and such but $15 a month and still locked out come on...  NO and I mean absolutely no way to contact them other than by email, NO in game or phone support, and maybe they will and maybe the won't respond to your ticket.  As I said it's a decent enough game as far as play ways, but anything else there are much better games out there."
"While the game is wonderful there is a bit to be said about game play lag and rubberbanding.  The lag is so very bad that you can't tell if you are coming, going, or standing still.  My son plays Battlefield on Ultra High with 200 fps but I still can't play in the Ettenmoors and many places in Minas Tirth without rubberbanding or standing while things go by..  I have a year subscription to the game hoping they would finally fix the problems with the collasped servers and installed new equipment.  That didn't seem to work.Bottomline...the game is awesome....if you could actually play without the frustration.  I can't find a similar game, any ideas?"
"this game is really really bad , dont even try its a waste of time. Bad graphics, Games pyhsics is the worse. Intro video will excite u if u are a fan of lord of the ring series. But the games is actually not that much exciting."
"Probably a good game, but I cannot reccommend. After installing / wasting 18.9GB you have to install every single other patch / iteration of the game since it came out. Sorry but Im not waiting 10 hours to try some f2p game..."
"Played as each of the classes for years, and mixed my skills until I found the best combinations. I've worked for weeks/months to get some of them. Now they made it so that you have 3 ""skill-tree"" based things, and only get a access to a third of your skills, based on skill type (DPS/Defence/etc). This means I only get a third of the legendary skills I worked for.In addition: I've worked for ages to level up and get what I have. New players can do it almost instantly now. This game has been dumbed down and made far more linear than it used to be in gameplay. I used to love it. I used to be excited to play it every day. Now launching it feels like a chore. The game was great - all they had to do was add more quests/maps. But instead, they changed the game, really badly messing it up. Would definitely not recommend it anymore."
"First of all I would like to point that I have around 4000 hours of time spend on this game and it was really hard for me to give thumbs down. Lord of the Rings Online is the game made me a game addict. I was playing the game day and night, ditching school to talk to few friends in game. Yes it was that enjoyable game.I would like to take you to time of Lotro' s golden years, Mines of Moria and Seige of Mirkwood. When you had amazing group content from dungeons to raids, each were original, challenging and fun. Classes in raids had diffrent jobs compared to others. You had to use more than 5 buttons to finish the boss session.Now, I was not a hardcore PvE player, the reason I played Lotro so much is that, its PvP gameplay. Not going to lie there were some balance issues, like any other mmo. But the feeling was so unique. Tactics were essential. Having fortresses were almost as important as fighting enemies themselves. Again classes had diversty.  You had to use more than 5 buttons.Those were the times as I was waiting for next expansion, Rise of the Isengard. Aka Fall of Lotro. At first it looked really fun, nice leveling. Great dungeons and challanging and original raids. All good. When I got geared, I stepped to PvP zone, since you had no PvP specific armours, you had to grind some PvE to be a decent player. Anyway when I stepped in, I saw a warg 2 wargs running at me. I was like '' Oh Isair now you are dead''. But what?! I practically 3 shot them. They couldn' even hit me properly. And it was when I realised what was going on, ever since Lotro went f2p, Turbine wanted players to pay for them. And you had to pay in order to enter pvp zone with your Free People character. So Turbine made Free Peoples (Freeps) lot stronger compared to Servants of mordor (creeps) And that was when balance in PvP simply dissapeared.Now if you were a PvE player, you might have enjoyed RoI. I do not know becouse I stopped playing on mid RoI due to unbalanced PvP.Then Turbine went full greedy, giving new expansions once in a year with no new decent group content or a decent look on PvP. Riders of rohan was lotro's last times with decent population. They somehow managed to bring slight tbalance to PvP. Freeps were still stronger but it was bareble. But even though I was not a main PvE guy, I compleatedevery single PvE content on RoR, why becouse all of them were easy as hell. So soem say (including me) that RoI was end of PvP and RoR was end of PvE.Aaaand we have Helm's Deep, highly hyped expansion. A hope for Lotro's epic comeback. But NOOOOPEEE. HD was the expansion that made Lotro fall to a position where it is now. A dying game where developers try to grab your money before it dies compleatly. Terrible PvP and even more terrible PvE where all you had to do was use you 3 slots of quickslot bard to compleate a PvE session.Rest of the expansions are fallowups of HD, really bad PvE and PvP. Although they brough some new PvE content (after 3 years) they are boring, simple and not worth it.Now I still play the game, like an hour a week. Why? Becouse of community. Community was what made Lotro great and still lets Lotro to live these hard times. Since you do not have any cross server stuff going on and low population, people know each other. Not by name maybe but by heart. You can start a random conversation in world chat and watch people you may know or not join it and have fun other than playing the game itself. Community of lotro is the best one you can find in any game. Friendship, love and trust just like in original Lotr. Final conclusion should you play this game? That really depends, if you play a game for PvE content, no. Go play WoW, rift or newerwinter.If you play a game for PvP, play swtor, gw2 etc.But if you want to play the game solely for relaxing chatting with other people and doing some events. Give lotro a try, you do not need to spend a lot of money since paying for either PvE or PvP just does not worth it atm."
"Been bad for about five years. This new raid will have it go from either Bad (its current state) to aweful or mediocre. This is the game you'd want to have played 8 years ago, but now, there are much better options in mmorpgs. I am playing this game because I am one of the original players from 2007. Until I find a new mmorpg, I'll stay here, but I do not recommend people buying this game at this point in time. I already bought it, so I might as well play it."
"Well...where do i begin...lets see...#1 Graphics are terrible even after downloading the ""HD textures pack"" #2 The game is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥ press 1 button and the game shuts down or gives you black screen and you have to restart your computer #3 The camera controls are terrible #4 The combat is easy as hell and is not involveing and any way you click on an enemy and wait for a while and...BAM you win.2/10 worth uninstalling"
"This was a very nice game before the changes happened. It's still fairly good if you love the Lord of the Rings series, world, story etc. It has nice quests with a good story behind it, but many people don't even read it. So that's sad imo. It wasn't challenging enough for me, hence why I stopped playing this. Like alot of other MMOs, this USED to be good."
"Literally unplayable. The developers have been bottlenecking resources from other servers to Landroval for a music ""event"" because they failed to foresee an issue with the layer system. So now paying subscribers on every other server suffer. There is 0 customer support, filing a ticket gets you nowhere. Asking on their official lotrostream or any other avenue gets you a ban instantly. When confronting a moderator my friend was told; ""Druidsfire: Because you asked a stupid hardware question and you know the answer to it. You're just here to troll, so ♥♥♥♥ off."" The same kind of responses happen to any questions regarding raids or pvp in this game. You are met with hostility from every gamemaster, moderator, or any person in a position of power, especially Cordovan the community manager for the game. It is on his authority that they are to ban people on their game forum and elsewhere for asking about these issues. As well as on his authority to retroactively ban former official streamers accounts for associating with those people outside of the game or in, with no reason given, and no lift date. Another major issue is their defunct system that Russians have cracked and figured out how to generate point codes, use them and then purchase store items to sell in world chat. If you purchase any of these items, whether or not you knew, you receive a ban. So all in all, if you want a broken game on servers that you cannot log into due to lag, and cannot play on due to lag, with  no customer service to speak with as well as the worst community manager who bans people for addressing game breaking issues as a paying member then Lotro is the game for you. I would not recommend this game to anybody, neither as a joke or to someone I loathe, it is that bad. This game had great potential, but it has been ruined by the takeover of Standing Stone Games. How they managed to take something and completely destroy it, fail to check for bugs before a live version goes through is beyond me. They market this as a free to play game, but there are cash boxes and you are basically required to subscribe to play past level 20. God forbid you have an issue because you won't hear back from their game masters for over a week. And when you do you'll receive a ticket closed update for not being online when they opened it finally."

"It's basically like playing any MMO except it's LoTR. It's not bad, and I haven't played much of it, but a clearer map marker might be a little more helpful. If you're into MMO's, this one is a good one."
"I don't play this game much for one reason, the cash shop.  I used to play it all the time.  But when you need Mithril coins to get HORSEBACK RIDING.  Kiss my butt.  Most f2p games give that for free.  Not to mention the fact that as soon as you leave the starting areas you have to pay.  This game is nothing more than a money-sink."
"Where do I start...I grew up with this game basically , and I still play it. From 2007 until now and forever :).It is the best MMORPG I have played and it has a special place in myself.It is basically an adventure game , free world exploration , but of course you need to pay so you can have a lot of adds in the game , with which you cant level to the level cap ( max level )I recommend this game to everyone who appreciates the hard work of Turbine. (Now Standing Stone Games)I`ve played it since 2007 and it gets much better as the years pass by...A lot of people say this game gets worse as the years go by , but it`s not true.I have over 1500 hours played by my characters and I dont regret even a minute played in this game.It`s a neverending adventure for any player who presses the ''Play'' Button and experiences the world of Middle Earth.I hope you`ve enjoyed my review , thank you . :)"
"This is just like every other MMO, If you like lord of the rings it can be intreging for a while. The only thing that kept me going was the hope i would get to see some cool lord of the rings stuff. But it never happens. they just tease you with it through out the entire game. trying to get you to pay. This is a cheap gimic to milk the mmo croud and people who like tolkens work.  Unless your a Billionare, and you can buy everything outright, then dont bother with this pay to win mess.This will always have a special place in my heart for being the first mmo I played. And it will be the last too. I got this back when it was new. Then i quit and played other games and some other mmo for a while.. I came back to this to see if i could finish it, the answer is no."
Bored? Drunk? Alone again on Friday night? Well now you don't have to be alone! But being drunk is probably a good idea if you don't want to be bored.It's LOTR:O F2P/P2W Edition! Now you can join the best music system in an MMORPG for as little or as much as you want to spend. 
"I'm torn on writing this review. On one hand, it's Lord of the Rings and seeing a hobbit trying to play a guitar solo on a harp using the in-game ability to play music is hilarious. On the other hand, it's excessively pay-to-do anything unless you're willing to fork over $15/month, has very little player-player interaction for a mmorpg, and only continues to be engaging because of the large number of areas to explore while leveling up. LOTRO, in my opinion, has more existing features to promote player-player interaction than maybe even WoW. However, it doesn't really have the player base that would use such features. Skirmishing (a.k.a. raiding) is almost impossible to find a group for outside of a kinsmanship (clan). If you like LOTR alot and enjoy the individual explorer feel that modern mmorpg's have become, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you want a mmorpg with an endgame, I just don't see it here."
"THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!!!! kidding man... its a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need to pay 4 everything. PLUS im a fan of evils. but this game needs you to make a character up to lvl10 to play as evils. as a fan of isengard and uruk hai's , the uruks equipment and appearence is♥♥♥♥♥♥and not lorific. also you cannot play as uruk hais in everywhere. only in a single place NOT RECCOMENDED 10/0.01"
"With all the hours in this game I just can't recommend this. The AI is clunky and the graphics have not kept up with todays. I like how I can go anywhere though, its just these pay walls and endless grinding with all the outdated systems just adds to the frustration. Not to mention the 8 hour download time, if it even works. You just might have to do some of your file digging to fix the installation and its folder, quite annoying. I really used to love this game and am glad its still getting updated, however until something BIG changes, I will have to tell people to steer clear for a whilst. Please overhaul this game."
"Awesome game.LOL, have 778 hrs on record!I love this game.Great music!Great Graphics!Great mechanics.You gotta play!Here is some of me playing the game with a good friend- https://youtu.be/4xqrWhoYZUsIf you check out my playlist there are hours you can watch :-P.Side note- I am VIP.It is free but at a point it will take a long time to continue being free. "
"Lotro ooooooh lawd. This game. Ignore my 180 hours, as this is just on steam since its been here, and i havent played that much since.I started playing late 2011, stopped mid 2013, in that time accumulating about 5 and a half months of play time across all characters, so 4000 or so hours.As a pvmp (basically the games form of PvP) player, it was bad. laggy moors, bad balance that was pve centred so left 1 side of the player field at a huge disadvantage etc. But it worked, because people played it; the population was enough for fun healthy PvMP. This was the best mmo ive ever played due to that.Then everyone (pvmpers) started leaving, as PvMP was getting 0 attention and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. The server merges came in, but they worked weird as they just deleted servers and told you to transfer off of them. Mine was one of these that was deleted, and all my enemies and people i used to see in the Moors were all gone. Rivalries died and♥♥♥♥♥♥went down rqIn conclusion, idk if the PvE is good, never played it, but i can tell that the PvMP is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that the people that made the game fun for me, my enemies that i knew for years as well as friends, are all just memories that i can only look back at.So dont download this game. Its dying, and youll just regret it when the friends you make here will be gone."
"This Game is really Great, very fun, However Customer service is the worst ever do not waist your money or time on this game you will regret it.Played for 7 years waisted countless time and Money only to have Customer Service ruin it all. they Locked/stole my account over a mis-understanding, one Phone call would have cleared it up in 5 sec.Did I mention they really dont have a support anything, email only if you have an issue ingame support is by GM only.But the game is really fun to play.Standing Stone is the worst game company out there and they will end up ruining this game for all time."
"For lovers of the Lord of the Rings (books moreso than the movies), this game demonstrates its lore and story to the absolute fullest, with certain creative liberties to make it feel more like an MMO too.As a LOTR fanatic myself, I find myself in the beginning areas wanting to scour them completely before moving on to the next one.The graphics are visually pleasing as well, which is really good for a game made in 2007 and how it holds up to today's standards. But there are options to lower it, so users with lower end PCs can enjoy it just as much.Overall, I think it's a very well-made game, my only gripes is that combat does become repetitive, and if you're not a fan of the setting, I think that could get boring for you. For me: 8/10."
"Played for hours on end with my badass bard, got into a guild, and had a blast. Then i came across a hobbet in the black forest (forgot the names of said hobbet). I was a completionist and i wanted some TP so i was runnning around till i spot a cottage. inside the cottage was THE gvayest mother♥♥♥♥in hobbet ever. skipping around or someshit, so i posted into chat (inserthobbits name) is freaking gay. BOOM 3 week ban from LOTRO for ""Disrespecting a Player""  This game is A-OK tho so go ahead and play it but dont you dare disrespect the NPCs. "
"A very well made game bringing hours of enjoyable game play...until...you hit the freemium wall. It may be free to play, however, it is impossible to proceed past a certain point without paying large sums of money."
"it's fun at first, but after you get to a high level, and run out of F2P quests to do, it starts to get boring, and if you, like me, can't afford the subscription, there isn't much you can do after you complete everything you can do as a F2P, which, compared to what you can do as a VIP player, isn't much, considering there's entire quest areas that are blocked off to you unless you have VIP or you buy it from the LOTRO store using premium currency, and you only get 2 character slots, which means you have to either buy VIP, make several characters across several servers and accounts, or buy extra character slots with premium currency from the LOTRO store in order to have more than two character or if you want to try a new character on the same server, and you already have both slots used across all accounts on the server, you have to delete a character or, if you've used all of the emails that you can, you'd need to make e new email just to make a new account for that character. I still recommend it dispite all of this, because of the fun factor of it up until you've completed everything you can do as a F2P."
Honeslty this is a mesertpiece of a game and i play it aevery day. The classes are phonominal and i really love the grind. my friend hollande thinks tat this game is garbage but he is just jealus because he couldnt get his Guardian past levl 8 (losser)
"Great game, fun gameplay, decent graphics. If you like games such as World of Warcraft but don't have to money to buy gametime every month, then this is the game for you.Just a shame it's pay2win."
It's a atypical mmorog with really sad low level quests and to much content blocked from free users. In the time I played I invested at least 20 dollars to keep the experience enjoyable. I do love the setting but can do without the generic feel
"Pretty Good! Of Course it steals the base of WOW, but f*ck world of warcraft. Anyways this game has a few control issues, SWTOR has better controls. And the maps are a bit big. Other then that I love this game"
"True to the lord of the rings spirit Lotro brings you straight into middle earth with all the lore you love, but sticks to the standard mmo gameplay style for most pve content you can chose from a few standard Lotr races and classes and jump into the story or just go at your own pace, but one thing Lotro does great is pvp, they have multiple pvp play modes and styles that allows for hours of fun. So whether your a tolkien fan or an mmo fan, you should definitely give this mmo a try."
"The Lord of the Rings Online:Tom Bombadil is the greatest character.SPOILER: He saves you from an (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) enemy named Sambrog.He bounces around singing 'Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!'"
"Enjoy stunning vistas renderd in low poly models and flat textures. marvel at hand drawn maps expertly crafted to offer no information at all. wonder about where the quest marker actually is. Enjoy unskipable cinematics paced by narcoleptics. read a whole lot of words about things you don't care about. Solve the challenging puzzles of the User interface. be stunned by exciting battle messages like ""you must face the target"" and ""can't do that while moving"". Seriously, it's not surprising this game is free to play; what's surprising is that anyone ever had the gual to charge for it, or that it took as long as it did to go free. it's almost 8 years old, shows every single minute of it and then some. The original Guild Wars (now long since shut down) predates it by 2 years, and surpasses it in every single aspect. Not even worth free."
"Very true to the feeling, setting, and lore of the books. Great time waster if you have friends to quest with, and an okay micro transaction setup. However grind takes over around level 20 and micro-transactions become much more intrusive. Seems every quest turns into grab x amount of x or kill x amount of x. Pros:LoreWorldItems""Free""Cons:PaywallsGrindFetchy questsIntrusive Micro-Transactions4.5/10"
"after installing this game and the outside software that is required by game maker ,my pc acted like it had a virus and after removing this game and outside software my pc was back to normal ,this software affected my pc in a major way even though i never played"
"i need help, the game just not starts, i don't know why, im pressing the bottom (create account) and nothing happens, plz help, the only thing its says is (failed to read authentication response[err: unexpected end of file][line: 1][col: 1])"
This is the game for you if you love Lotr. If you do not then try another MMO. The bad thing about this game is that it forces you to pay a lot of money if you want a good experience.
"Personally, I am a big Lord of the Rings fan. This game is outstanding. If you love the story and love mmo's then you will be able to look past it several flaws. One flaw is that this game is free to play. As a free to play user, you are force to spend a massive amount of money to acquire Turbine Points. Eventhough the game allows you to earn them, it takes a substantial amount of time to progress through the game. VIP is definitely the way to go if you can afford the $15/month subscription fee. The many festivals, events, and just the people you meet is enough to make you suspend reality if only for a moment. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is definitely, in my opinion an 8.5!"
"well, i have yet to open the program... i have downloaded it and registered but after all of my attempts to open the game i have never seen the game itself.not looking too good for the devs, or the game...we will see if anything comes of thisbut as for now its noting more than a game that will probaly be be uninstalled says error opening game files may not have permission to write to them... what ever that meansoh well, is a bad review for now untill i see something done"
"-Be me-Running around Bree-Find a bard dwarf in jail playing music-He's playing the USSR anthem-""Wait!"" the dwarf says upon seeing me-Dwarf somehow breaks out of jail and starts playing YMCA for meI give this game 10 disco communists out of 10.Also the entirety of the hobbit race is now my children except that one hobbit who laughed at me. 20 hobbits out of 10."
"Product received for freeGreat game overall but a word of warning, this game is not very welcome to beginners at RPG genre. The complex skill systems, how to get around the map without getting lost is very complex and copious as this game is literally the LOTR scaled to what its supposed to be.The Atmosphere and enviroment is a great thing to enjoy and explore but there are pro's and cons as many games do. Some suggestions could be that they update their combat system and explain to players how everything works clearly as I stumbled a lot through the game not knowing what are how to interact or do certain things. Other things that would be great if they would give discounts on the monthy subscriptions at certian times or events, as it is annoyance that certian interactions would not be available."
"Product received for freeMy first MMORPG. I started playing a year ago and am still as in love with it now as I was when I first started playing. Great community and always something fun to do. The epic story line is great and pretty true to Tolkien's vision. As a huge fan of Tolkien, the story line is the most important factor to me in any game/movie/etc. that is Lord of the Rings, and LOTRO does a beautiful job of telling the story and bringing Tolkien's legendarium to life. Great game for those who love LOTR or just having fun."
"All I can say is this: Amazing game! And it's totally free! Where else can you explore Middle Earth for zilch$? Highly recommended. One warning though: on Steam, they're selling the Triple Pack for 39.00$ and you can get the quad pack for the same price on the LOTRO store."
"As MMOs go, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar isn't half bad. Although it's gone through several permutations over the course of its lifespan, it is currently a free-to-play title with a very hefty amount of actually-free material. As a man, hobbit, elf, or dwarf, you must rise up and begin fighting back against the various forces of Sauron, indirectly aiding the Fellowship of the Ring as they make their march to Mount Doom. Fans of the LotR universe and devout Silmarillion enthusiasts will have a lot to enjoy here; the world is packed to the gills with obscure names and lore trivia, and seeing every square inch of Tolkien's world fleshed out is actually rather thrilling (according to the massive Tolkien nerd I live with anyway). As a moderate fan of the books, I personally found the world better designed and more atmospheric than most MMO worlds, but nothing to freak out about.As for the gameplay, it's solid and incorporates many of the best features of modern MMOs. Forming groups for skirmishes and dungeons is easy, quest tracking is convenient, and inventory management is a breeze... assuming you're willing to pay a couple bucks here and there for content. Playing the purely free version of the game is a little more aggravating, but still playable and enjoyable. You miss out on some inventory space, some class options, and eventually a lot of quest access, but by then you'll know if you like the game, and as game costs go everything is pretty reasonable.Along with the usual assortment of MMO quest grinding (so many boar heads and bear butts for strangely insistent random strangers...), there's also a surprisingly substantial Epic quest chain for each race, making up the actual storyline for the game as your character works with Strider, Gandalf, and many others to save the world from the generic eeeeeevil of Mordor. While I hesitate to call it ""gripping"", it's a hell of a lot better than it could have been. The only aspect of the game I found lacking was the near-absence of PvP. While players who pay the monthly fee for VIP status get access to a MONSTER PLAY mode, it seems a bit essential to include that in base play.I could go on, but there's not much to say here beyond it being a solid, high-budget, free-to-play MMO that provides decent returns for your investment in the expansion packs, and which fans of a particular legendary fantasy writer may go nuts over. I had a good two weeks tromping from Shire to Moria, and I'm throwing in the towel without a bad taste in my mouth. For an MMO, that's a hell of a lot better than average."
"There are a lot of great MMO's out there. Maybe this has the core concept of being one of them, however it is extremely outdated. The UI, the combat, the graphics, the gameplay. This is an old MMo that feels old. Graphics are one thing, but when I'm playing a MMO and it feels as old as it is (signifying no attempt to modernize) that's when It gets the thumbs down."
"so after installing, there was a patch.. the patch took almost an hour..After getting in game i chouldn't believe how badly writen the dialog was. The controls where clunky and it was awkward movin around and fighting.I continued to play through the beginer quests, and ended up in some mines, i got to my objective.. then it didn't update.. so i carried on through the mine and found myself to be stuck.. i typed /stuck to see if it worked.. it did.. but rather then unglitching me it crashed the game.. So basicly 5 hours of my time, plus the 40 odd minutes of actual game play.. this is one of the worst mmo's i've even laid eyes on."
"Dont get it, back around mines of moria expansion, this game could be up to WoW standards and maybe any better. Now........ The creaters of runscape have more intelligance than the staff here. You ask for help, they will not respond."
"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It wasted an hour and a half of my life doing nothing but loading things and nearly crashing. After it installed, I couldn't even enter the game because the character creation was broken. Nothing but low-res menus on a black background. I couldn't even select a race! Buttons were randomly blacked out and the entire thing was horribly laggy. It was an absolute monstrosity. 1/10, and they only get the 1 because the intro movie was somewhat entertaining."
"A great concept and I love some of the artwork, but it falls into the WoW catagory. Also, I would like to have my own adventure in this beautiful and rich world, not relive the exploits of famous in-game characters. Cool for big fans of the work, but noone else."
"Too blocky and slow, doesn't play fluently and character design is limited. lags at high graphics and everything is in a gross haze. Not enough movie reference, characters are robotic, and looks poop. I would rather play Runescape than this."
"not a bad game as far as MMORPGs go. It's always a shame though that you're only able to play one side, being the ""good"" side. Of course, I have yet to find a game that's not like that.."

"It was really fun. Untill I got to Rivendell, and found out that you have to either pay or use Turbine's Turbine points (595 to be exact) to unlock the next pert of the main quest. What the hell, Turbine? This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t move similar to Electronic Arts (EA) would pull."
"Check out our Steam Curator Page and Website[bluntlyhonest.review] for even reviews and exclusive content!I say to myself.. it's a beautiful world...LOTRO is beautiful, while the graphics are clearly from their launch era, the tweaks ove rthe years have kept them looking pretty, the landscape and quests are authentic to Tolkien's lore, the class selection and race selection is well thought out, crafting when not in its neglected levels/era is very fun, the music system is one of the best in any mmo, with entire musical festivals occuring several times a year, fantatsic selection of mounts, thriving rp scene, decent selection of festivals, the game has many good points, so this review will start off with the base of ""very good"" and focus mostly on the not so good to give a balanced picture.If I could turn back time.Lotro at times suffers heavy lag and when riding a warsteed its even worse I was once teleported back over 400 metres due to server lag/latency, vaults and bags can take ages to open and mail time out at times of heavy traffic.Money, Money, money its a rich man's world.The business model for lotro is extremely dated, to start today and to unlock all the needed quests to reach cap you would need.    1)A subscription to unlock all post level:30 quest packs or grind store currency for multiple hours on throwaway toons        to unlock one region at a time as a free player.    2) Quad Pack: first 4 expacs: $40.    3) Helms Deep expac : $40.    4) Mordor Espac: $40-140 depending on version.In my opinion all pre Mordor content should be free to subs, and all pre Mirkwood content free to everyone, as while 30 levels of content was generous once, its now less than 15% of the games overall content, compare with guild wars 2 giving entire base game, and swtor giving entire base game, which includes all 8 class stories and all planetary stories.I would grind anything for fun, but I won't grind that.Lotro is a grind-heavy game, everything takes grinding from levels, virtues, class points, reputations, weapons XP, horse XP, deeds, legendary weapons alone take hundreds of scrolls which drop at 1-3 per instance and tens of thousands of gold to max the weapons to their fullest potential.While some work has been done to reduce the grind, very little overall has been removed from the lower level/former endgame grinds, leaving new players with an ocean of grind to reach the endgame, if they want to complete everything.It's a mad world..a mad world.Each Executive Producer of LotRO seemed to not share the vision of those before or after, its resulted in a mad mix where some level regions have little to no crafting solo or group content.1-50: a good mix of everything.50-60: a good mix of everything.60-75: crafting almost extinct,  very few items to make, and most not best in slot, one or two exceptions, heavy instance focus, many amazing dungeons and raids.75-85: Heavy story focus, reduced crafting, hit and mix endgame.85-95: a little more crafting focus, endgame replaced by a new instance tyle that was not very popular with classic dungeon runners, story decent but lacking.95-100: mostly story and rng grind based, very little group content, no dungeons, crafting neglected.100-105: towards end of this level region instance content returned, 2 instance clusters, and a raid, crafting gets a small boost towards the end of the 100 level regions, before being obsolete again for entire 105 eras.105-115: a good mix of content, a massive grind required for dailies, barter system requires huge amounts of rng based grind.115 (first quest pack just launched for 115): group content almost not existent till fall 2018, crafting took a back seat again, dailies/grind focus endgame, oh but we got 4 fiddles for music system :|Worth a Play?Certainly, despite all its faults, LOTRO is a very solid MMO with a dedicated medium-sized player base, a large percentage of players have played since day one and the overall majority of players have been with the game 5-7+ years, a poor game wouldn't keep the loyalty of so many for so long.New players still join most servers on a daily basis, and the community by far is very welcoming of them, answering questions, offering aid, crafting gear etc.https://bluntlyhonest.review/2018/03/27/lord-of-the-rings-online-adventure-in-the-land-of-massive-lag-and-middle-grind/ "
"This game is a lot of fun if you can get past the graphics and the fact that there aren't nearly as many players as more popular MMOs. If you're a fan of the LOTR books or movies, this game will be even better and more immirsive. Basically, just try it, what's the worst that could happen? My expectations were low when I started and I've really enjoyed the expirience so far."
"Gameplay & review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvmvvjHdNdM&index=1&list=PLySWle9ZKHFiP46KV1Iq8gOBZGBMP1_aIJake's been watching & reading a lot of Lord Of The Rings lately and had a real hankering for playing a game based on it. So he approached me and Evil to see if we were interested in playing Lord Of The Rings Online with him? We were!I haven't read/watched LOTR for many years but was happy to much around on another MMO with the guys! We get up to our usual mischief and discover some really weird abilities & places withing LOTRO.Suffice to say we had a real blast in this game, and it's free too! We all recommend it heartily (in fact we're still playing it right now!)"
"I tried to get this game to work multiple times, I really did (way to much time actually). I downloaded it twice through steam and once from the LOTRO website. Each time I got to the game launcher, but then it would fail to download the prerequisites (basically it would get stuck at 33% everytime). I tried every single suggestion that was put on forums on steam and the LOTRO website. Most said just turn off the proxy, others said turn off your firewall and antivirus (which isn't the best suggestion might I add). However, for every suggestion made on the forums it apparently worked for a few but not everyone. There was never a definitive fix that would work for everyone. Finally, after spending all day on it and trying really hard to get it work, I just gave up.It's sad, as I was really looking forward to playing the game. But apparently the developers of this game can't be bothered to spend the time to fix this issue that has been around since 2010 (by all the forums I've read), so I guess I won't be able to ever play this game."
"Downloaded this game to try it and after a few hours I can say it's not my cup of tea.From the moment you enter the game it is trying to sell you things that, in my honest opinion, should be free.Riding skill should be free and class choices should never be locked behind paywalls.Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to pay for cosmetics and xp boosts, etc, I do it all the time in other games, but as soon as I am prevented from accessing what I consider core game mechanics I immediately hate the game.Yes, the game is free to play but honestly there are far superior games like Tera, Archage, and swtor that wipe the floor with lotro in both gameplay and graphics, and while this game would have looked fantastic back when it was first launched, in 2016 I expect much more, even from free games.For these reasons I have uninstalled this game and cannot recommend it to any serious MMO players looking to invest their precious life hours."
"This is my absolute favourite free to play game of all time, as I am a massive LOTR fan, all things that you would pay for can be bought with in game currency (Even DLC) , this remains to be a great game, I hope you all enjoy this close-to-perfect-in-my-opinion game XD. Fair Winds All "
"I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I waited 5 hours for this damn game to download (yes slow internet i know) and when it was finally finished, after i had created my account and whatever else, i was unable to play the game. On the character creation screen i can't click anything, if i do it swaps out of the game to anything else i have open. Waste of 5 hours smh."
"If you're a fan of Middle Earth, and theme park MMOs from the WoW Clone era this is for  you. It distinguishes itself by adding a ton more immersion than most of the genre through things like player written music, naming conventions that match the Lore (""kinship"" instead of ""guild"", ""Fellowship"" instead of ""Party"") and more. Its classes are unique, and do an ""ok"" job of pushing the envelope on the Tank, DPS, Healer trifecta. Pros include one of the only F2P programs that doesn't penalize you for being a F2P player, but instead only rewards you for paying in a fair and balanced way. It also is one of the few MMOs from the era whos community isn't largely toxic. Graphically it is a bit dated, but not nearly as bad as games such as Everquest 2 (there are 3 years between the 2 so not a 100% fair comparison). It is strictly GCD style combat, and the questing while taking you though places and meeting NPCs you'll know from the lore is still of the  ""Gathering Bear Asses"" variety."
"man....this game takes years to download and then when it downloads the launcher has moare updates , oh jesus christ theres a fire , a fire in the lands of mordor but i heard that this game was as good as mythril , but despite all the long time downloading and patching it is a decent mmo , very good if you are a lotr fan but , very grindy. :)"
"A thoroughly excellent game. Great up until about lvl 55, and a little less great afterwards, but still phenomenal. If you're a fan of Tolkien's fantastic books, you may very well enjoy this game."
"Played this game for a long time, great game. The areas are beautiful and go along with their lore perfectly. You can do pretty much anything in the game, from fishing in the Shire to mining in the dangerous Moria. Overall, i would certainly recommend the game to anyone looking for an mmo"
One of the older MMO's but if you love the world of Tolkien you will love this. This game as loads of content so theres plenty to do and see at your pace. The deeds/achievements give you turbine points to spend in store so if you are playing on the ftp you can unlock expansions & content by grinding these out.
This game is beatiful and good but for me its boring.If you want try it i dont say it is not good its good but for me its boring.I'm a big of lord of the rings but i dont like this game.
"THis is a great game, with major problems.  It is nearly 10 years old and the expansions are fantastic, however, the bugs are almost intolerable. The servers go offline and online a lot due to the datacenter moves, you would think 10 years in that most of the bugs would be worked out, but, not.  That and players using bots all the time and whatnot, I fear this game is dying. The forums are full of negativity toward Turbine.  It isnt cheap to subscribe, and you get little or no support.There are a huge amount of players that adore this game, but Turbine are killing it."
"For fans of the LOTR saga, (and now also the Hobbit saga) this game is right up your street.It captures ALL the moments from the film, be it items, to characters/npcs, or simply landscape/areas.Problem is, thats just about where the fun of the game, ends.It's pretty much the same things that you have to kill, in different zones.Lots of re-skinned and tougher stats for monstes across the world, and it's really sad to see this, but then of course... LOTRO based their game of the old style WoW... You can see it with so many things which are alike with both gamesit's uncanny.From the combat, right down to the crafting system, and everything inbetween.Honestly, getting into a Guild, is normally the way to go with MMO games, as it tends to draw you into the game more, as you form bonds with your guild-mates.However, for me... This is a game that I would actually like to enjoy Solo, and really experience the world and all it has to offer, for myself.Sadly, even doing this though, the fact that there are so many re-skins and multiples of monsters which are boring and dull. (Generic types are Goblins, Orcs, Spiders, Wolves... etc)... That was enough for me to finally, after 60+ hours of game time, to put the game down for good.I can only recommend this game to the hardest of LOTR die-hard fans, who want to immerse themselves inside Middle-Earth.They can look past the boredom of the combat system, amongst many other simplistic functions of the game.For everyone else, nope... You will likely hit the wall I have... and look for a more modern day game, which has more variety in it, excluding different skins for monsters."
it is like the best mmorpg game ive ever played i played it a lot on my old account and it was so fun. I 100% recoment this instead of WoW. 2 reasons why. 1st - its free hello......... 2nd - its free hello......
"Me and a friend tried this game, I got a *ehem* SUPPORT bard and he took a dps warrior.He didn't played the game because I oneshoted everything with a south in a 50m area.10/10 would AAAAAAH -200 hp again."
"Still a very good mmoi would wish though that the game got new graphics, sounds and free world multiplay, a building struktures future allso open up for players that plays it alot to open the expansions for freeoverall it was or still is a good mmothough it still misses alot from the books "
"I love it.The in-game store is a little bit iffy. Pricing is done in a way so you'll need / want to spend more.I can't comment on the free-to-play side of it in terms of classes, I dove straight into a Beorning which costs 900(not exact) TB to unlock one slot or 975 TB something to unlock the class for as many slots as you please.RP servers seem really dead recently, but from those I've seen they're probably with their kinships and guilds, etc. Otherwise it really does feel dead, any player who does show themselves is usually either not talkative, or wants to spar, all. the. time.Features Housing too, which (lowest for me was 950 Silver coins.) does feel a little grindy in terms of getting one. most quests give 1 silver and 90 copper.100 copper - 1 silver.1,000 silver - 1 gold.I'm level 16, played for 15 hours - gold is almost a myth, although I imagine when I reach near the cap it'll seem like it's flowing.Try it."
"I enjoyed it immensely in the past and upon trying to play it now, the newest patch downloaded fine but something happened with server communication. Might be something you want to look into. Currently deleting then redownloading it to see if it works. Still  really enjoy this game"
"I love this game. Its a great way to expand in the ever loved LotR Universe. While it may have take quite a few creative liberties, it is still a fun game to pick up and play once in a while."
"Better and simpler than WoW. I like. Can be somewhat P2W, but not much. Overall, nice, simple MMORPG that feels like WoW, but a bit smaller and simpler. Holds up well for its age. 8.5/10"
"This is one of my favorite mmorpg games to date! I started playing back when the game was first released and played regularly all the way through several expansions. The community is great. The devs hear what the community has to say and what we want out of the game, and does their best to implement those things. PVP is fun as hell, roaming solo or run through as a kinship. Raids in this game are fun as hell, and the scaling is awesome for stuff that isnt your level. I give this a 9/10"
"Amazing game 8/10There's a lot of bugs, I'm not gonna lie. The bugs aren't gamebreaking so you'll survive. Other than that it's an amazing game, with loads of lore and exploring. The leveling system is slow AF but it isn't about leveling, It's about enjoying the experience of the universe.I'm currently playing it solo, I'm in a kin so I'm not completely alone, but I prefere to quest alone and LOTRO is a nice and calm solo experience. The Community on the server are amazing, everyone helps everyone and people are nice and mature. This isn't a game filled with 13 years old and it's noticable. If you really wanna enjoy this game it's not F2P. You should think of the F2P title as a trial to for the game, because if you don't pay anything it's gonna be hell to play through. I myself don't mind spending 35.99 Euros on steam market for most expansions and 14.99 Dollars monthly for VIP. I know the money will be spend well, and I'd gladly give some money for the cause. So if you don't mind spending some money on the game, you really should buy into this game, bacause it's really ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.All in all I'll recommend this game for the Middle-Earth fans and MMO fans. If the game was supported better and not F2P the game would be much better. I myself support the developers in any way I can, you should too! :D"
"I can't put into words how much I love this game. I understand how it might have been different in the past, but overall all the free playable content is astounding.I love this game and I try to play it every chance I get.It features all the best parts of a RPG/MMO, including factions, creatable characters, creatable homes, changeable ability sets, mounts, craftable items, races, classes, and the graphics and detail are overwhelmingly beautiful.The quests are simple enough for the ""casualest"" gamers (such as myself), yet detailed and challenging enough so that it is not boring. Future quests grow with you, and become some of the most memorable times played in the game, and are just tough enough to leave you wanting more.I can't go on enough without spoiling the whole thing for you, but as a HUGE Tolkein fan, and for those that aren't, it is hands down the best Medieval/Reneissance/Dark Ages/Fantasy MMORPG that is out there."
Probably the only chance Tolkien fans will ever get to feel part of Middle-Earth and have the freedom to travel around such an amazing world. I'd recommend playing on a Role-playing server as the communities are really cool and the experience is just way more immersive.Favourite memory was my first steps into the Barrow Downs and the quests involving Tom Bombadil.Play with friends for a way more enjoyable experience!
"Subscription aside (I can't pay for it yet), this game is beautiful, it really feels like you're in the world you've only read, seen, imagined that is Middle-Earth. Me and my cousin definitely enjoyed this game, especially because you can play instruments in it. Not that we know how to compose songs but the fact that you can play songs as a band is fun. Try not to get killed by orcs."
The game looks really aweesome to be such an old game and like it could be really enjoyable....... But i would think with its age and all the time they have put into this game they would have fixed some of the bugs and the computer crashing and now when i go to restart the game the start up screen is not responsive i can put in my password and click enter it says failure to obtain authintication code and the other buttons dont work like forgot password and creat account so dont know whats up with that my computer can definately run the game i play neverwinter all the time. gonna uninstall reinstall see if that will fix the issues  
"I played this game while reading Lord of the Rings for the first time, and the first 100+ pages match up right with this game. I loved it. Roleplaying was fantastic too. I played as a hobbit and had other taller players laugh and poke fun of me as a hobbit. I'm not short in real life, but it gave me a little bit of little man syndrome for a while. XD"
"The Lord of the Rings, a much loved franchise throughout almost all households and families bought to MMORPG format.It's brilliant.Fluid battle controls, unique quests, ultimate storyline, friendly community no matter the age. It's all you could want from an MMORPG based in Middle-Earth."
"Well the pay to play has sucked us all in once again. I dont know about you guys but i for one love it. Good game, good content, crappy level caps, and landlocking at the lower levels. Grind it out boys, and run to the next area. worth a good day's fun."
"I've absolutely loved this game of LOTRO. I usually play with a group of four, sometimes six people. Which then allows us to go into higher level places and be challenged. I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves fighting either with lots of damage up close, or damage at a distance, also just for the community. I have made great friends from all over the world."
its a good game but it seems to be buggy i bought the vip with the rest of my steam card and the dang thing stopped working on 2 seprate quest i would be quite pleased if the bugs could be fixed
"Exploring a world we know so wellIf you're into the whole Middle-Earh genre, then this game is a must-play! Despite simplistic toon-like graphics, and give quest/complete quest/receive reward gameplay the ability to roam throughout Middle-Earth and interact with charaqcters we all know and love is captivating. I think I have an 'Alt' (alternate chartacter) in each of the character classes now and am enjoying levelling them all at the same time. I'm loving the ability to take my time and not rush towards end-game!"
"Well made game based on Tolkien world. While ist not perfect game, I think that all Tolkien lovers will like it. It has beautifull scenery and even great storyline, different for each playable race. Ypu can play solo, in fellowship (group), it has decent PVP (different from many MMO's), there are dungeons, skirmishes, epic battles you can farm and you can even roleplay on special server if you like. You can even buy house in game and decorate it.However, game is more pay to win, and has some big restricions if you cannot or do not want to pay. I would recommend to subscribe as VIP, so you can enjoy game to the fullest (or at least once spend money in game to became premium member, which has some restrictions lesser). If you want to play for free, Turbine gave us possibility to obtain Turbine Points (in game real money) in game by completing deeds and questing, so it is possible to just farm TP if you have time and will to do so. However, you cannot pay VIP with grinded TP or even became premium. These must be bought with real money.I love this game and don't even mind to pay VIP for it, so I would always recommend LOTRO for all lovers of Tolkien."
"Great game.It has dozens of hours of content to play.Graphics are average, as expected being an older game.Well balanced and highly recommended if you are at all interested in MMOs or Lord of the Rings"
"Because City of Heroes shut down....But the Free to play alone is worth it. Lets face it, you are not starting a game like this without knowing you are going to devote many hours to it. Take the time to grind out the Turbine points and you will get all the content for free, not to mention complete bascially all of the content to truely see this game to end game...Its pretty damn fun too..."
"Even though the game is showing it's age, it's one of those mmos that I always go back to (at least) for a while. While (imo) they got housing wrong, they didn't make the appearance system or the barbershop into an insane gold sink or a money grab. If you're a huge Tolkien fan, then you could do a lot worse for Middle Earth-themed games."
" I love this game, I have been playing this on and off for about 5 yrs now, forget how many hours steam says i've played this...add another 2k hrs,This game is awesome,yes the graphics are a little dated,but omg, it has a little bit of everything, the 2 things which keep me hooked to this game are the soundtrack and the lore, I don't think i've ever felt so immersed in a game, when you enter a new area and you feel like you're in the lotr movie, wether it's strolling towards Rivendell or charging across the plains of rohan on your warsteed,this game has hours of replayability and the playerbase is one of the friendliest I've ever seen in any MMO."
"We've been playing LOTRO for years now and Standing Stone Games just keeps making it better and better.  They have and continue to add new content as well as addressing age old issues.  We highly recommend this game for anyone even slightly interested in Tolkein fantasy.  Come one and all, young or old - enter a better fantasy world."
"Also im Allgemeinen ist das Spiel schon Dreck. Da man aber im 2. Teil der Hauptstory Chewbacca spielen kann und der Hero op ist hat man die Chance ganz China zu vernichten. Dieses kleine Gimmick macht das Spiel zwar auch nicht besser aber wenigsten für 1-1,5 Stunden erträglich. Also ich selber bin schon jahrelanger Lord of the Rings Online Fan und kann es nur weiterempfehlen, sofern man keine Freunde oder Freude am Leben hat."
"Good graphics, fun combat and very easy to learn unlike other MMOs. Killing enemies is rewarding as you can loot everything and the customisation is brilliant. Like other MMOs there's Co-op but god know's how to set that up...So yeah I'd reccomend it if you're looking to get into something like this."
"Its a very cool game and its one of the few mmo where p2p exists but a f2p player has all the same rights, abilititys and locations that can be inlocked with a relativly light grind."
"I am a fan of this game but that won't stop me from saying the truth. This is an mmo set in Middle Earth, and that's where this game differentiates from World of Warcraft. It has the same combat and quest types and similiar graphic styles. I'm not saying it's bad, hell it's the best mmo I have ever played, but that doesn't change the fact that if you have played WOW then you have played this game. However, this game is set in the Lord of the Rings world with the armours and lore that makes the world so original. If you are done with the current MMO hotkey style gameplay and are looking for a new type of game than go ahead and skip this one, but if you are thirsting for a new mmo, havent played WOW, or if you are just generally interested in the LOTR world then go ahead and download this game and get immersed in one of the best stories created.Updated for Badge"
"I never fell for the World of Warcraft hype when it first launched. I've tried several times to jump into it with both feet but failed each time. The game just doesn't have any pull for me. Lord of the Rings Online however is a different story. It's a much more casual MMORPG that doesn't eat up all your time, but still manages to be immersive and works very well with the lore of Tolkiens works. This has been the only MMORPG I ever got hooked on. I first played it at launch and still return to it from time to time. LOVE this game"
"This is really a good game! I love the Middle Eath that I can explore myself. The Epic of The Lord of The Rings is all showed in this game! It is a great fun ""living"" in Middle Earth!"
"Sadly I cant recomend this due to the fact that most of the quest are just killing , talking or finding someone or something. Its fun for the first hour or so but then after you get the true missions. If you want to do certain things or go to certain areas you must buy a membership or something else like that."
"The game has too many technical problems.  I have only been able to install it on 1 out of 3 Windows machines.  One of those would play for a few weeks, and then no longer launch the game.  Really limited information online about how to fix it.  It would be nice if I could send logs / diagnotic information somewhere for these problems.  It doesn't look like I'm the only user with the problerms.The game has plenty of free content to get comfortable with the world and game system before deciding to put more money into it.  Staying ""free"" means slower progress, less areas to explore, harder to manage inventory with less slots, no mounts, etc. "
"I wanna love this game so much, yeah its a quest grind but the story is wonderful. But alas the cash shop nickel and dimes you to death. I dont get how a game goes free but you really have little choice but to spend. I understand that you can grind points but my goodness that is a pain also. I played several years ago when it was pay and really liked it but i was playing EVE hardcore at the time so let it be. Looking for something else atm so i can let it be again."
"Well for a Play for Free game I didnt make it very far. After downloading the game and trying to log in the launcher it says : ""No subscription for LOTRO found"".What subscription? It was suppossed to be Play for Free according to Steam....."
"So far, I have no been able to make an account to play the game - which is dissappointing to say the very least as after playing some LEGO Lord of the Rings I was ready for exppore Middle Earth in a more, shall we say, Mature manner. Even through the game is free, there is no way I can recomand this untill this issues is fixed. I'm sure I would fully enjoy this to the ponit of buying all DLC but as I can't make an account to play the game there. If anyone has any suggestions as to how to fix this, then please tell me.I will update this review, and my rating may change depending on what happens."
